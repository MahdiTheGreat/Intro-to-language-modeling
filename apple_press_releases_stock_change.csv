Bukit Batok Skyline HDR panorama with iPhone XS Max, processed in Snapseed I finally doubled down on upgrading my phone after using the iPhone 6s Plus for close to three years. The camera is indeed a huge step up, with all the new computational photography features like the Smart HDR delivering great results for a phone! I’ll miss using my @oowalife 15mm on it though, so hopefully they’ll make a case for it soon. #shotoniphone #shotoniphonexsmax . . . . . . . . . #citygrammers #guardiancities #art_chitecture_ #openmyworld #sky_high_architecture #lensbible #arquitecturamx #arkiromantix #agameoftones #agameof10k #cityunit #todayweexploresg #freezfram #hbouthere #hotshotz_architecture #rsa_streetview #icu_architecture #openmyworld #passionpassport #rustlord_cityview #tv_pointofview #urbanrising #visualarchitects #leagueoflenses #heatercentral #fatalframes #yngkillers #urbanaisle @sgig @sgarchitecture @instasg @gov.sg @todayweexplore @urasingapore @archdaily @appleorchardroad @apple

It’s not often I venture to the other side of the river but an after work trip to Eastlands was required. As I was heading over the Tasman Bridge I thought this might be an alright pic so I stop under the bridge went for a walk. Got back in the car and drove home and I never ended up going to Eastlands. Probably for the best really. . . . #tasmaniagram #tassiepics #tasmania #tasmanbridge #hobartandbeyond #instatassie #spring #monday #reflections #discovertasmania #exploretasmania #abcmyphoto #derwentriver #mtwellington #kunanyi #australia #australialovesyou #ig_captures #australiagram #aussiepics #wow_australia2018 #earthpix #global_hotshotz #iphonexs #mobilephotography #instameets_tasmania

I haven’t had time to process completely, but I wanted to remember everything so started with just jotting down the special happenings of each day. This will be the starting point for a future visualization I hope to create to capture the magical sequence of events that unfolded which somehow led me to be with my best friend who lives across the country when she gave birth to her first child ahead of her scheduled due date. Oh and I was in NYC to check out the new #iPadPro + #applepencil which is what I used to make this journal entry. It’s crazy how much this piece of tech has changed my career trajectory (thus, life) and the latest update is 👍👍 + ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ + 🤗 + 💙💙

╳ NEW iPad Pro. ⠀ Excited and proud to say that I’m one of the first artists in the World to create with @apple ‘s new #ipadpro & #applepencil ! ⠀ This is a crazy tool for experimental projects to merge digital drawings, traditional art and mobile photography together. ⠀ I’ve used some of my calligraphy paper sketches, @procreate app as the main tool, #shotoniphone photos and @adobe @lightroom apps for color editing. ⠀ This is the next level of my creativity. Some of these artworks will be used for my upcoming new clothing collection! Stay tuned.🤘🏻🔥 ⠀ _______________________ ⠀ Друзья, я стал одним из первых художников в мире, которые работают с новым айпадом от Apple! ⠀ Делюсь с вами актуальным сетапом — Скан моих каллиграфических работ, перевод в диджитал, мобильная съемка и коррекция в Lightroom, финальная работа в Procreate. ⠀ Получается очень удобное комбо для путешествий и работы там, где вдохновение приходит внезапно — на улице, в отеле, в метро. Везде! ⠀ И очень приятно быть в авангарде этого движения. Всем привет и ванлав из Нью-Йорка! Ждите принты из этой серии в рамках моей новой коллекции одежды. 🖤

С одной стороны - да, это начало катания на горных лыжах, я очень жду это время! С другой - скоро начнётся минусовая температура, придётся бегать из кафе в кафе, чтобы окончательно не замёрзнуть 😏 Посмотрим, что покажет нам ноябрь! 😎 А я пойду, пока что, посижу на крыше, пока погода позволяет! 😂👌🏻

Petrified Forest National Park was fun to shoot with iPhone XR - the Smart HDR thrives capturing this type of environment. Did you get a XR today? Have any questions? See link in profile for full review!

This has to be my favourite installation at @teamlab_news #TeamLabBorderless Shot this with the new iPhone XR which is available for sale from today. I love the size of the screen which is between the size of the iPhone XS Max and iPhone XS. It works beautifully in low light with the same 26mm lens as iPhone XS. Best bang for buck iPhone if you don’t need the dual lens and OLED display. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #ShotOniPhone #ShotOniPhoneXR #Apple #SGIG #Tokyo #TeamLab #TheCreatorClass #ExploreToCreate #AGameOfTones #LiveAuthentic #VisualsOfLife #VisualAmbassadors #TheImaged #InspirationCultMag #CreateCommune #LowLight #Nike #JustDoIt

2020-06-26,Decrease,WWDC20 highlights,"Even when I'm not physically attending#WWDC20, that Friday feeling still comes back. Hope it never ends 😢pic.twitter.com/gXWGcTr1Ll
Wearing my WWDC19 sweatshirt to commemorate the last day of#WWDC20! It’s been a great week full of announcements, fun virtual community events and learning. Even with the new virtual format, WWDC still stands to be one of my favorite weeks of the entire year.pic.twitter.com/K3ks2kkfYD
3 super insightful lab sessions today. Learned a lot, asked ton of questions and the feedback/responses I received was on point. Man, what an experience.I hope virtual labs continue for years to come. 🤞#WWDC20
My jaw was on the floor throughout this session. Absolutely mind-blowing and you know for sure that I'll make something (hopefully good) out of this by Fall.https://t.co/9IV1a98rrz
Credit where credit is due - seems like the#SwiftUIteam did a great job! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Source stability ftw! 👍🏽https://t.co/G3dAbhLOne
I finally got my jacket and pins! Thank you@Apple@EEhare@tim_cook#swiftstudentchallenge#wwdc20pic.twitter.com/79IAjNMbqL
I’ve attended 4 remote WWDC labs so far and all of them have been such great experiences. Great conversations and all of my questions answered 💯🙏
Sketch notes for “Building Trust Through Better Privacy”.I hear some devs are already noticing changes in the iOS 14 beta 🕵🏻‍♀️#WWDC20#WWDC2020#iOS14pic.twitter.com/lVN4WYbfvR
ARKit4 scene depth point cloudAwesome!!!#thedesignium#ARKit4pic.twitter.com/89TMYa39dC
To me feels like#WWDC20has actually brought the iOS community closer, there is no FOMO - just people learning and sharing -#iosdev
iOS 14 comes with support for Sound Recognition in Accessibility. Your phone can now listen for specific sounds – a baby crying, smoke alarm, water running, etc. – and notify you.Amazing feature for all kinds of users – inclusivity at its best.#WWDC2020pic.twitter.com/3hIL8JuTyB
Okay, now I wanna switch back to Mac...#WWDC2020#macOSA BIG yes SUR!pic.twitter.com/oN3HByEzvG
Thanks@tim_cookfor re-emphasizing that we can both be excited about#WWDC20& push further for the fight against racism through starting off the keynote this way ✊🏽pic.twitter.com/mmO6TvV4C7
Honestly this is huge for developers. I mean imagine the possibilities with this... instead of building a web version of your app, you can already Rey on macOS users to use it directly on their computers#WWDC2020and honestly#PUBGMOBILEhere come the troubles 👏🏾😀@PUBGpic.twitter.com/pGYXiMSWVD

Power 2021 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction StudySMand received a chart-topping score of 864.1Apple Card and issuer Goldman Sachs also ranked highest in the Midsize Credit Card segment across all of the surveyed categories, including interaction, credit card terms, communication, benefits and services, rewards, and key moments.
“It is exciting to be recognized with this first J.D. Power win, just two years after introducing Apple Card in 2019 and the first time being included in this study,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay. “We designed Apple Card to help our customers lead healthier financial lives, so it’s incredibly meaningful to see that our customers are valuing this. Being recognized as the leader in this category this year is an honor, and we look forward to continuing to deliver this product, service, and support with our award-winning issuer as Apple Card expands to more and more customers across the U.S.”
“Nothing energizes us more than the affirmation that we are providing a simple, transparent product that delivers value and that customers love,” said Harit Talwar, Goldman Sachs’s chairman of Consumer Business. “Creating this experience with Apple has been incredibly rewarding, and we are committed to continuing to deliver best-in-class service to our customers. It takes a village, and I am grateful to my colleagues at Goldman Sachs, the teams at Apple, and all of our partners who have helped us be No. 1 in customer satisfaction in the U.S. credit card industry.”
Apple Carddisrupted the credit card industry when it launched in 2019 as the first credit card designed for iPhone.

UPDATE
Apple celebrates 105 years of America’s national parks
Apple is donating $10 for every Apple Pay purchase at Apple to the National Park Foundation through August 29
As the US National Park Service turns 105, Apple today is sharing new ways for customers to learn about and celebrate America’s parks. This week through August 29, Apple will make a $10 donation to the National Park Foundation for each purchase made with Apple Pay onapple.com, in the Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store in the US.1An Apple Watch Activity Challenge and special content collections will also let customers explore the parks, or celebrate them from home. These collections will be available on Apple Maps, in the App Store, the Apple TV app, and on Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and Apple Music.
“With every passing year, our national parks only become more precious,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re honored to play a small role in helping even more people explore the parks, learn about their history, and renew their love and appreciation for the planet we share.”
Apple’s contributions to the National Park Foundation have helped fund youth programs including the Mosaics in Science Diversity Internship Program. The internship provides underrepresented youth with meaningful, on-the-ground work experience in natural resource science career fields.
“It has always been a dream of mine to work for the NPS,” said Edwin Torres, a recent graduate from Central Washington University interning at North Cascades National Park. “I view these parks as spiritual places that allow you to build your connection with nature. I have always considered that having the opportunity to work in these parks is a great privilege, and through this program, I have been able to learn skills that will help me pursue a career in natural resource management. I feel confident that I will be able to use my experience from this program to meet the dynamic challenges that our parks face.”
“National parks are landscapes of wonder and learning,” said Will Shafroth, National Park Foundation’s president and CEO. “Thanks to Apple’s ongoing partnership and commitment to connect young people to America’s diverse natural and cultural heritage, we are helping the National Park Service excite and engage students with educational opportunities across the country.”
Apple is also encouraging users to learn more about the parks through special content collections.
Apple Maps will feature 24 curated Guides from the National Park Foundation to help people discover and experience these treasured landscapes. These Guides include more than 400 sites that the National Park Service protects, from hidden gems and exciting urban escapes that are just a stone’s throw away from America’s biggest cities, to parks where kids of all ages can explore, learn, and grow. Apple users can also save national parks to My Guides, create personal Guides, and share them with friends and family while planning a trip.
The App Store is celebrating the National Park Service by spotlighting the official National Park Service app as the App of the Day. Users can further enjoy the beauty of the national parks by exploring the Essential Apps for Hikers collection, which highlights apps including Outdoorsy – RV Rentals, which helps users plan their trip; AllTrails: Hike, Bike & Run, which surfaces new outdoor routes; and WaterMinder, which reminds adventurers to stay hydrated.
Apple TV app users can find a collection on Watch Now that celebrates the history, stories, and wonder of the national parks, spotlighting shows like Ken Burns’s “The National Parks: America’s Best Idea” and documentaries like “Free Solo.”Apple Podcasts will feature a collection of shows focused on exploring and celebrating the outdoors for listeners in the US throughout August. On Apple Books, customers will find a collection of books for adults and kids that will inspire families to get out and explore our national parks. And with the “Nature Awaits” playlist on Apple Music, listeners can hit play, lean back, and let their imagination wander, even if they’re unable to head outdoors.
On August 28, Apple Watch users around the world are encouraged to appreciate the natural beauty of national parks by participating in an Activity Challenge. Apple Watch users can earn the limited edition award and animated stickers for Messages by completing a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile or more on this day.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple, US developers agree to App Store updates that will support businesses and maintain a great experience for users
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced a number of changes coming to the App Store that, pending court approval, will resolve a class-action suit from US developers. The terms of the agreement will help make the App Store an even better business opportunity for developers, while maintaining the safe and trusted marketplace users love. Apple appreciates the developer feedback and ideas that helped inform the agreement, and respects the ongoing judicial review process.
The agreement clarifies that developers can share purchase options with users outside of their iOS app; expands the price points developers can offer for subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paid apps; and establishes a new fund to assist qualifying US developers. The updates constitute the latest chapter of Apple’s longstanding efforts to evolve the App Store into an even better marketplace for users and developers alike.
“From the beginning, the App Store has been an economic miracle; it is the safest and most trusted place for users to get apps, and an incredible business opportunity for developers to innovate, thrive, and grow,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App Store. “We would like to thank the developers who worked with us to reach these agreements in support of the goals of the App Store and to the benefit of all of our users.”
Providing More Flexibility and Resources for Small Developers
Following a productive dialogue, Apple and the plaintiffs in the Cameron et al v. Apple Inc. developer suit reached an agreement that identifies seven key priorities shared by Apple and small developers, which has been submitted to the judge presiding over the case for her approval.
Launching the News Partner Program
Today, Apple also announced additional App Store updates with the launch of the News Partner Program. Recognizing the importance of rigorous journalism and a free and independent press, the program includes a new slate of initiatives to expand Apple’s support for journalism.
To participate in the program, news organizations must provide their customers with access to their content in Apple News using Apple News Format. Participating organizations will benefit from a 15 percent commission on qualifying subscriptions to their news app. Paired with the App Store Small Business Program, this new program will help provide multiple avenues for news organizations to make their content available to Apple customers while supporting local journalism. For more details on the program, visitapple.com/newsroom.
With the updates announced today, the App Store continues to evolve into an even better business opportunity for developers, while maintaining a safe and trusted marketplace for users. Already, Apple provides more than 30 million registered developers with all the tools, resources, and support they need to create and deliver software to over a billion customers around the world on Apple platforms.

A new type of healing, supported by Apple
Biotech startup SweetBio and VC firm VamosVentures receive funding through Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative
Two years ago, Lauro Salvador injured his foot in a work accident, but for the 55-year-old diabetic, his ordeal was far from over.
Salvador was cleared to go back to his job, but the injury hadn’t yet healed and his foot became progressively worse. He eventually found himself at the emergency room at Memphis’s Regional One Health.
Doctors there worked to save his foot, but after an initial surgery failed, they suggested amputation.
“I said ‘please don’t do that,’” says Salvador. “I was so scared. I asked if there were any other options.”
That’s when his physician, Dr. Tony Alleman, suggested a course of treatment involving a new wound care product from SweetBio.
SweetBiowas founded by sister and brother team Kayla Rodriguez Graff and Isaac Rodriguez, whose family is from Puerto Rico. Their goal is advanced wound care for all, and to achieve this, they’ve harnessed the power of a surprising source: honey. Specifically, Manuka honey, which is derived from bees pollinating the Manuka tree and has been shown to have antibacterial and healing properties, according to some studies.
SweetBio is one of a number of Latinx-founded companies that has received funding fromVamosVentures, a venture capital impact fund that invests in diverse, technology-enabled companies across the country.
As part of Apple’s recently launched Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), the company has invested a collective $50 million into a number of firms that focus on Black- and Latinx-owned businesses, including VamosVentures.
“We want to be more than just another investment fund,” says Marcos Gonzalez, founder of VamosVentures, whose parents both immigrated to the US from Mexico. “We want to create a portfolio of companies that are led by Latinx and diverse founders and can generate real impact — both social and economic. The fact that Apple has made a meaningful commitment to our fund shows that they recognize the challenges that exist for these kind of businesses and they want to be part of the solution.”
Gonzalez saw in SweetBio an opportunity to both support a Latinx-founded business and to target an important issue for the greater Latinx community.
“Not only do we believe in the mission and these founders, not only do we recognize the hurdles that are presented to people of color in general — especially women — but we also believe that the product that they’re developing could be very transformational for communities of color,” says Gonzalez.
For Kayla, whose background is in business, and Isaac, who has a PhD in biomedical engineering, developing a product that could potentially help so many was the driving force behind SweetBio.
“Honey has been used since the ancient Egyptians to treat wounds,” says Isaac, who named the wound dressing APIS, after Apis mellifera, the scientific name for the honey bee. “And it’s still being used today in hospitals, but it’s messy and non-containable. So we worked to bioengineer that ingredient and deliver it in a sheet that can be manipulated easily.”
“We saw that the biggest need was in wound care, specifically for diabetic ulcers,” says Kayla. “And diabetes targets communities of color the hardest, so that’s where a lot of our initial exploration has happened.”
Doctors at Regional One Health have been using SweetBio’s APIS dressings as part of a pilot program for the last year.
“The city of Memphis is about 60 percent African American, and a high number of our patients are living at or below the poverty line,” says Dr. Reginald Coopwood, Regional One Health’s president and CEO. “So I’m very proud that we’ve set up our Innovation Center that provides access to startups like SweetBio — companies that are trying to find new and innovative ways to solve chronic health care issues around complex populations.”
Dr. Tony Alleman runs the hospital’s Wound Care Center and has seen positive results from the SweetBio product for a number of his patients.
“I think APIS is a good product and it’s very easy to use,” says Alleman. “We had one diabetic patient who had a foot wound for months and we tried a number of things to no avail. We then tried the SweetBio product and within two weeks, his wound was closed.”
Dr. Alleman also used APIS on Lauro Salvador, as part of an alternative course of treatment to avoid amputation. As a result, the wound closed.
“At first I was hesitant to try a new product, but it saved my foot,” says Salvador, who later became aware that APIS was created by a Latinx-founded company. “It’s a proud moment to know that members of my community are doing this.”
Kayla and Isaac hope that success stories like these are just the beginning, as they work to scale their product for national availability by the end of 2022. In addition to the pilot program at Regional One Health, which will culminate in a retrospective study, there is also a clinical trial underway in conjunction with Vanderbilt University.
“To have our dream supported by a company like Apple gives us fuel to keep going,” says Isaac. “It allows our idea, and the bold ideas of future generations, to be translated into products and services that are going to improve the quality of life for people.”
“Isaac and I started this company to help people heal,” says Kayla. “And what I didn’t understand when we first started was that yes, we’re helping wounds heal, but more importantly, we’re helping families and communities heal. That kind of change takes a village and we’re incredibly proud that VamosVentures and Apple are supporting us on our journey.”

Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today introduced the News Partner Program, a new slate of initiatives to expand Apple’s work with and support for journalism. The News Partner Program aims to ensure Apple News customers maintain access to trusted news and information from many of the world’s top publishers, while supporting publishers’ financial stability and advancing efforts to further media literacy and diversity in news coverage and newsrooms.
The News Partner Program is designed for subscription news publications that provide their content to Apple News in Apple News Format (ANF).

ANF also supports advertising, and publishers keep 100 percent of the revenue from advertising they sell within Apple News. To support publishers who optimize more of their content in ANF, Apple News is offering a commission rate of 15 percent on qualifying in-app purchase subscriptions from day one.
“Providing Apple News customers with access to trusted information from our publishing partners has been our priority from day one,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “For more than a decade, Apple has offered our customers many ways to access and enjoy news content across our products and services. We have hundreds of news apps from dozens of countries around the world available in the App Store, and created Apple News Format to offer publishers a tool to showcase their content and provide a great experience for millions of Apple News users.”

The renowned classical music experience is coming to Apple Music
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA AND LONDONApple today announced it has acquired Primephonic, the renowned classical music streaming service that offers an outstanding listening experience with search and browse functionality optimized for classical, premium-quality audio, handpicked expert recommendations, and extensive contextual details on repertoire and recordings.

In the coming months, Apple Music Classical fans will get a dedicated experience with the best features of Primephonic, including better browsing and search capabilities by composer and by repertoire, detailed displays of classical music metadata, plus new features and benefits.
“We love and have a deep respect for classical music, and Primephonic has become a fan favorite for classical enthusiasts,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “Together, we’re bringing great new classical features to Apple Music, and in the near future, we’ll deliver a dedicated classical experience that will truly be the best in the world.”
“Bringing the best of Primephonic to Apple Music subscribers is a tremendous development for the classical music industry,” said Thomas Steffens, Primephonic’s co-founder and CEO. “Artists love the Primephonic service and what we’ve done in classical, and now we have the ability to join with Apple to deliver the absolute best experience to millions of listeners.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple broadens Racial Equity and Justice Initiative with $30 million in new commitments
Efforts include the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub, expanded learning opportunities for HBCUs, the first Apple Entrepreneur Camp for Hispanic/Latinx Founders and Developers, and funding for organizations driving criminal justice reform and environmental justice
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced $30 million in new commitments as part of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), supporting students, innovators, and advocacy organizations that are leading the charge in creating a more inclusive, more just world. These new projects include a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub; expanded education initiatives for community colleges and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs); a new cohort of the Apple Entrepreneur Camp immersive tech lab for Hispanic/Latinx founders and developers; and funding for leaders working to advance criminal justice reform and environmental justice.
These new commitments build on Apple’s $100 million initial investment in REJI, and will help elevate equity-focused solutions across the academic and advocacy landscapes. As 60 percent of undergraduate students at HSIs and HBCUs are Hispanic/Latinx or Black, Apple’s new projects will help equip the next generation of students and leaders to dismantle structures that perpetuate inequities and institutional racism.
“The call to build a more just and equitable world is an urgent one, and at Apple, we feel a collective responsibility to help drive progress forward,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “The commitments we’re sharing will help the young leaders of today and tomorrow start new businesses, develop groundbreaking innovations, and inspire countless others to join the fight for justice. We’re grateful to all of the trailblazing organizations we’re partnering with for their tireless dedication to equity as we work toward a better future together.”
Expanding Access and Equity in Education with the Launch of the Innovation Hub
Apple is partnering with the California State University (CSU) to launch a Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub. This public-private partnership between the state of California, the CSU, and Apple will work in collaboration with HSIs throughout the nation to foster student success by equipping learners — including Hispanic/Latinx, Black, and Asian American students — with skills for high-demand careers. Apple’s commitment will support the initiative’s main location on the California State University, Northridge campus in Los Angeles, and provide Apple technology, design support, and thought partnership as the project expands. The partnership will launch equity-centered programming focused on transforming HSIs throughout the CSU and across the nation. It also seeks to expand by establishing regional HSI Equity Innovation hubs at affiliate colleges and universities, and through partnerships with national organizations committed to advancing this work.
“By reframing service through an equity and racial-justice lens, the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub seeks to exponentially accelerate educational equity across the CSU system and the nation,” said Erika D. Beck, president of CSUN. “We are thankful for Apple’s support as we aim to shift away from thinking about what students must do to be successful, instead thinking about what our institutions must do to successfully serve the Latinx community and students from other underrepresented groups. The Equity Hub at CSUN is an ideal site to continue collaborating on proven strategies that benefit all.”
Applying an interdisciplinary approach, programming will focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and will leverage technology to inspire students to become the innovators and creators of the future in STEM.
“The CSU takes great pride in providing pathways to STEM education and preparing students for careers that power the world’s fifth-largest economy,” said Joseph I. Castro, chancellor of CSU. “Thanks to the bold vision from the state of California, Apple, and other legislative leaders, the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub will greatly benefit thousands of talented students in California and beyond.”
In partnership with Tennessee State University, Apple is also supporting the expansion of the HBCU C2initiative to 11 new schools — including Clark Atlanta University, Florida A&M University, and Texas Southern University — bringing the total number of community coding centers and regional hubs on HBCU campuses to 45 across the country. The program, which launched in 2019, empowers and supports HBCUs to bring coding and creativity experiences to their communities, using Apple hardware and its Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create curricula.
“In the three years since we teamed up with Apple, we’ve brought coding and creativity courses and experiences to thousands of HBCU students and community members,” said Dr. Glenda Baskin Glover, president of Tennessee State University. “We’re proud of all that we’ve accomplished, and cannot wait to continue building this impactful initiative together as we create a more equitable future, open doors to new opportunities, and ensure our students have access to cutting-edge careers.”
Elevating App Founders and Technologists from Underrepresented Backgrounds
Apple will expand its Entrepreneur Camp program to welcome its first cohort of Hispanic/Latinx founders and developers next year. Participants in the immersive tech lab for app-driven companies founded and led by developers from underrepresented backgrounds will have the opportunity to work with Apple experts, engineers, and leaders to take their app experiences to the next level. They will also become members of the Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni network, a world-class group of ambitious leaders who have gone on to secure major funding rounds, garner numerous awards and accolades, and significantly expand both their teams and app users worldwide.
“We are focused on advancing enduring change, and our newest grant commitments will further that effort by supporting problem solvers and solution seekers in communities of color nationwide,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Education, economic opportunity, and environmental justice are fundamental pillars to ensuring racial equity, and everyone has a role to play in this critical mission.”
Investing in Criminal Justice and Environmental Justice Organizations
Apple has committed to investing in organizations that support racial justice, including the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, The Council on Criminal Justice, Innocence Project, The Last Mile, Recidiviz, The Sentencing Project, and Vera Institute of Justice. These commitments will also help to promote racial, ethnic, economic, and gender justice, as well as the safeguarding of youth and working to end the practice of extreme sentences in the criminal justice system.
“The Last Mile strives to break the cycle and curb the problem of mass incarceration in America by focusing on education, vocation, expansion, and workforce reentry,” said Beverly Parenti, executive director and founder of The Last Mile. “We are thrilled to have Apple support our mission as we work to build better opportunities and futures for the communities we serve.""
Apple is also partnering with a number of community colleges to implement programs that will help incarcerated and paroled individuals learn new skills and work to prevent recidivism. In Texas, at Houston Community College, Apple will contribute funding and technology to a program that supports individuals on parole and probation to prepare for career and college readiness. In California, Apple is supporting the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD) in creating programming for the Community Collaborative Courts, an initiative where the Los Angeles County Probation Department works with prosecutors, attorneys, and judges to refer at-risk offenders to LACCD as an alternative to traditional incarceration. And in Louisiana, Apple is working with New Orleans’s Delgado Community College to develop an anti-recidivism program.
Additionally, Apple is committing funding to Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-led organizations that are grounded in advancing environmental justice, and advocating for communities most impacted by climate change and environmental disparities. Recipients include Hispanic Access Foundation, First Nations Development Institute, and the Center for Rural Enterprise and Environmental Justice.
“For more than a decade, Hispanic Access Foundation has been working to address environmental hazards directly affecting our Latino community and establishing bridges that provide equal access to a more healthy, natural environment,” said Maite Arce, president and CEO of Hispanic Access Foundation. “We’re thankful for Apple’s support, which will directly heighten our impact, help us deepen community engagement, and ensure that we continue to bring more equitable solutions and opportunities to the forefront.”
Funding will expand critical work emphasizing environmental stewardship, advocacy, and leadership in overburdened communities, and expand upon Apple’sImpact Accelerator, which helps combat systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities impacted by climate change.

PRESS RELEASE
Japan Fair Trade Commission closes App Store investigation
Apple will let developers of “reader” apps around the world link to an external website to set up or manage an account beginning early next year
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced an update coming to the App Store that closes an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC). The update will allow developers of “reader” apps to include an in-app link to their website for users to set up or manage an account. While the agreement was made with the JFTC, Apple will apply this change globally to all reader apps on the store. Reader apps provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video.
To ensure a safe and seamless user experience, the App Store’s guidelines require developers to sell digital services and subscriptions using Apple’s in-app payment system. Because developers of reader apps do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase, Apple agreed with the JFTC to let developers of these apps share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account.
Before the change goes into effect in early 2022, Apple will update its guidelines and review process to make sure users of reader apps continue to have a safe experience on the App Store. While in-app purchases through the App Store commerce system remain the safest and most trusted payment methods for users, Apple will also help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases.
“Trust on the App Store is everything to us. The focus of the App Store is always to create a safe and secure experience for users, while helping them find and use great apps on the devices they love,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow who oversees the App Store. “We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up and manage their apps and services, while protecting their privacy and maintaining their trust.”
This update follows a number of changes to the App Store announced last week, which give developers more flexibility and resources to reach their customers, tailor their price points, and grow their businesses. Last week, Apple also launched the News Partner Program to support local journalism and help news organizations on the App Store.
With the update announced today, the App Store continues to evolve to be an even better marketplace for users and developers alike. Already, Apple provides more than 30 million registered developers with all the tools, resources, and support they need to create and deliver software to over a billion customers around the world on Apple platforms.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple announces first states signed up to adopt driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet
Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah are among the first states to bring state IDs and driver’s licenses in Wallet to their residents
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced that it is working with several states across the country, which will roll out the ability for their residents to seamlessly and securely add their driver’s license or state ID to Wallet on their iPhone and Apple Watch. Arizona and Georgia will be the first states to introduce this new innovation to their residents, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enable select airport security checkpoints and lanes in participating airports as the first locations customers can use their driver’s license or state ID in Wallet. Built with privacy at the forefront, Wallet provides a more secure and convenient way for customers to present their driver’s licenses and state IDs on iPhone or Apple Watch.
“The addition of driver’s licenses and state IDs to Apple Wallet is an important step in our vision of replacing the physical wallet with a secure and easy-to-use mobile wallet,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “We are excited that the TSA and so many states are already on board to help bring this to life for travelers across the country using only their iPhone and Apple Watch, and we are already in discussions with many more states as we’re working to offer this nationwide in the future.”
“This new and innovative mobile driver’s license and state ID initiative with Apple and states around the country will enable a more seamless airport security screening experience for travelers,” said David Pekoske, TSA Administrator. “This initiative marks a major milestone by TSA to provide an additional level of convenience for the traveler by enabling more opportunities for touchless TSA airport security screening.”
Seamless and Secure Experience
Driver’s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will provide an easy, fast, and more secure way for people to present their driver’s license or state ID using their iPhone or Apple Watch. Once a participating state begins offering this capability to its residents, customers will be able to add their driver’s license or state ID to Wallet and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to present it to the TSA, without taking out their physical card or handing over their device.
Security and Privacy
Wallet provides a convenient and more secure way to present driver’s licenses and state IDs, while offering superior security and privacy over a physical wallet.
States Across the Country See Benefits of IDs in Wallet
States across the country are looking forward to the superior security and convenience that driver’s licenses and state IDs in Wallet provide to them and their users.
“Arizona is at the leading edge of states making mobile IDs available to the public, and we are pleased to work with Apple and give Arizonans the choice, convenience, and security of adding their driver’s license to their Apple Wallet,” said Eric Jorgensen, director of the Arizona Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Division. “Beyond being innovative and exciting, a digital version of a driver’s license offers increased security and privacy for our residents, making it something everyone should consider.”
“We’re excited to bring a new addition to our state’s modernization efforts that will make our residents’ lives easier, and keep their identities secure through the use of mobile driver’s licenses in Apple Wallet,” said Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. “We’re pleased to be one of the first states working with Apple to deploy driver’s licenses and state identification cards in Apple Wallet, and we’re looking forward to taking the next steps to make sure this new feature benefits our residents.”
“Georgia is a national leader when it comes to the safety and security of its driver and identity credentialing process, with more than 99 percent of Georgians REAL ID compliant, and the state of Georgia is equally as committed to safety and security through our mobile driver’s licensing (mDL) efforts with Apple,” said Spencer R. Moore, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Driver Services. “Together, we will deliver customer convenience through touchless identity verification and enhanced security and privacy protection through technology. We are honored to work with Apple as an initial adopter for such a revolutionary customer experience. A state-issued credential has become the standard for which institutions of all sectors use as a trusted source of identity proofing. The identity proofing bar has been raised significantly thanks to Apple and innovative states like Georgia.”
“We are glad to see Apple advance the acceptance of mobile driver’s licenses by offering a secure and convenient way to present a mobile driver’s license with Apple Wallet,” said Melissa Gillett, director of the Iowa Motor Vehicle Division. “Privacy and security have been at the forefront of our mobile driver’s license development process and we appreciate Apple’s proven reputation in these areas, as well as the shared commitment to following the ISO 18013-5 standard.”
“The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet is excited to be leading the pack through this innovative collaboration with Apple to further deliver on our pledge to take driver licensing to the next level,” said Matt Cole, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Vehicle Regulation. “The potential for mobile driver’s licenses is limitless, and we look forward to taking steps to continue to offer modern conveniences to Kentuckians while maintaining our unwavering commitment to security and privacy.”
“Maryland is proud to be a leader once again in safe innovation with the implementation of mobile driver’s licenses,” said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. “As we look to the future, we are committed to enhancing convenience and accessibility while maintaining the highest safety and security standards for our state and citizens.”
“We are excited to work with Apple on mobile IDs in Apple Wallet. This innovative project is yet another example of the momentum we are building as a state in our continued efforts to be a national leader in the digital transformation space,” said Jerry Moore, CIO of the state of Oklahoma.
“Utah has always been a forward-looking state. We regularly hear from people who want to access their driver license through their phones,” said Jess Anderson, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety. “This is a great opportunity for Utah to work with Apple in an innovative use of technology. This secure mobile license adds convenience while helping keep Utah safe.”
Participating states and the TSA will share more information at a later date about when support for mobile driver’s licenses and state IDs in Wallet will be available in each state, and which TSA airport security checkpoints and select lanes it will be available at first.
Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch offers an easy, secure, and convenient way to do everything from paying for groceries to accessing your favorite entertainment venues. With Wallet, users can pay in-store, online, and in-apps with Apple Pay, pay for and ride public transportation in cities across the globe, unlock their car, and access airline boarding passes, event tickets, and loyalty rewards programs. University and college students, as well as faculty can also tap their device to use their mobile student ID in Wallet to make purchases and get around campus. Coming soon, Wallet will also provide access to customers’ home, apartment, and hotel keys, as well as corporate badges. More information on Wallet can be found atapple.com/wallet.

UPDATE
Today at Apple Creative Studios expands to Chicago and Washington, D.C.
Following recent Creative Studios launches in Los Angeles, Beijing, Bangkok, and London, Today at Apple’s mentorship programming comes to young creatives in Washington and Chicago
Next month, Today at Apple Creative Studios will bring its career-building programming and creative resources to underrepresented communities in Chicago and Washington, D.C. These two new cities expand on the programs launched earlier this summer, which explored a variety of creative passions across music and radio production, photography, app design, and more. Led in collaboration with community partners, local nonprofits, and Apple, young creatives in Washington and Chicago will have access to mentorship, hands-on experience, and the industry know-how to dive deep into photography, illustration, and writing.
Since the program’s launch in June, Today at Apple has brought Creative Studios to Los Angeles, Beijing, Bangkok, and London, linking 24 nonprofits and community partners with 80 teaching artists, mentors, and industry experts. Apple works intimately with nonprofit partners on multiyear plans to ensure that support continues in these communities and for these participants long after their Creative Studios programs come to an end. Additionally, people around the world have joined online sessions with the program’s accomplished mentors, including photographer Bethany Mollenkof; Ebro Darden, Apple Music’s global editorial head of Hip-Hop and R&B; and iPhone photographer Eric Zhang.
“We’re so excited to be able to connect young people from underrepresented communities with artists and mentors to guide and inspire them in Washington and Chicago,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “In each city where we’ve launched Today at Apple Creative Studios, our partnerships with incredible community organizations have enabled us to bring creative arts education to those who need it most, and we look forward to bringing Creative Studios to even more cities.”
Today at Apple Creative Studios - Chicago
Launching September 18, Today at Apple Creative Studios - Chicago will work with youth in Little Village to amplify up-and-coming talents’ unique stories through photography and illustration. In collaboration with community partnersYollocalli Arts Reach,Instituto Justice and Leadership Academy, andChicago Architecture Biennial, Apple will provide free arts and cultural programming across five weeks to aspiring artists and photographers, offering the tools they need to embark on their creative journey.
Chicago-based photographers Mercedes Zapata and Sebastián Hidalgo will serve as mentors, guiding participants through a combination of portraiture, journalistic assignments, Photo Walks, and immersive design activities that will enable the youth to capture their community.
“Yollocalli Arts Reach is the award-winning youth initiative of the National Museum of Mexican Art, and it has provided creative development opportunities to young adults in Pilsen, Little Village, and the surrounding communities since 1997,” said Hananne Hanafi, deputy director of Yollocalli Arts Reach. “It is our goal to provide a safer space for our students to not only grow as artists, but to also become active members in their communities. We are thrilled to be working on Today at Apple Creative Studios - Chicago, and we look forward to seeing all the amazing artwork from our participants.”
Today at Apple Creative Studios - D.C.
Today at Apple Creative Studios - D.C. will give aspiring authors and illustrators an opportunity to hone their creative and professional skills while expanding their ability to tell their stories in their own words. The program, which officially begins September 20, aims to diversify the landscape of children’s and youth literature, and is presented in collaboration with local nonprofitShout Mouse Press— a writing workshop and publishing house with a mission to amplify marginalized voices — and students from theLatin American Youth Center. Through Shout Mouse Press’s authorship program, students from the LAYC have authored a collection of four bilingual children’s books. Over the six weeks of programming, the students will take these stories through illustration and audio production to reach new audiences and expand their capacity for storytelling.
“Shout Mouse Press is dedicated to centering and amplifying the voices of marginalized youth,” said Kathy Crutcher, founder and executive director of Shout Mouse Press. “The young people we coach are underrepresented — as characters and as creators — within young people’s literature, and their perspectives are often unheard. Apple shares our commitment to providing a platform for diverse voices, and we are proud to partner with them to support young authors in telling their own stories.”
Participants will further hone their unique narratives through six weeks of Apple-led skills-based sessions, and will also learn from established authors, multimedia artists, and illustrators, including Zara González Hoang, the founders of “La Horchata Zine,” and the co-hosts of “La Valentina Podcast.” The program will culminate in a celebration of the release of the students’ books, which will be available as ebooks on Apple Books, and also in print.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple reveals Apple Watch Series 7, featuring a larger, more advanced display
A refined design with enhanced durability, faster charging, new aluminum case colors, and watchOS 8
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcedApple Watch Series 7, featuring a reengineered Always-On Retina display with significantly more screen area and thinner borders, making it the largest and most advanced display ever. The narrower borders allow the display to maximize screen area, while minimally changing the dimensions of the watch itself. The design of Apple Watch Series 7 is refined with softer, more rounded corners, and the display has a unique refractive edge that makes full-screen watch faces and apps appear to seamlessly connect with the curvature of the case. Apple Watch Series 7 also features a user interface optimized for the larger display, offering greater readability and ease of use, plus two unique watch faces — Contour and Modular Duo — designed specifically for the new device. With the improvements to the display, users benefit from the same all-day 18-hour battery life,1now complemented by 33 percent faster charging.
Apple Watch Series 7 is the most durable Apple Watch ever, with a stronger, more crack-resistant front crystal. It is the first Apple Watch to have an IP6X certification for resistance to dust, and maintains a WR50 water resistance rating.2
The newest Apple Watch continues to offer indispensable tools for health and wellness, including an electrical heart sensor and ECG app,3and a Blood Oxygen sensor and app.4watchOS 8 helps users stay healthy, active, and connected through new workout types, the new Mindfulness app, innovative accessibility features, greater access with Apple Wallet, and more capabilities with the Home app, along with enhancements to Messages and the Photos app.
Apple Watch Series 7 introduces five beautiful new aluminum case finishes, along with a range of new band colors and styles. The entire Apple Watch Series 7 lineup will be available later this fall.
“Apple Watch Series 7 delivers significant improvements — from our largest and most advanced display, to enhanced durability and faster charging — making the world’s best smartwatch better than ever before,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Powered by watchOS 8, Apple Watch brings useful new capabilities to help customers stay connected, track activity and workouts, and better understand their overall health and wellness.”
New Design and Optimized User Interface
The stunning display of Apple Watch Series 7 offers nearly 20 percent more screen area and thinner borders at just 1.7 mm — 40 percent smaller than those on Apple Watch Series 6. Through an innovative design that maximizes the screen area while minimally changing the dimensions of the overall case size, Apple Watch Series 7 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes. While the wrist is down, the Always-On Retina display is up to 70 percent brighter indoors than that of Apple Watch Series 6, making it easier to see the watch face without having to lift the wrist or wake the display.
The user interface is optimized to take advantage of the shape and size of the new display. Apple Watch Series 7 offers two additional larger font sizes, and a new QWERTY keyboard that can be tapped or swiped with QuickPath — allowing users to slide a finger to type — and utilizes on-device machine learning to anticipate the next word based on the context, making text entry easier and faster. With watchOS 8, larger menu titles and buttons in apps like Stopwatch, Activity, and Alarms also make the screen even simpler to interact with.
Most Durable Apple Watch Ever
Apple Watch Series 7 features a redesigned front crystal with a stronger and more robust geometry that is over 50 percent thicker than that of Apple Watch Series 6, making it more crack-resistant without compromising optical clarity. Apple Watch Series 7 is also certified IP6X dust-resistant, making it more durable in environments like the beach or the desert, while still maintaining excellent swimming performance with a water resistance rating of WR50.
Faster Charging
Apple Watch Series 7 provides all-day 18-hour battery life on a single charge, and 33 percent faster charging compared with Apple Watch Series 6, through a new charging architecture and Magnetic Fast Charger USB-C Cable.5
watchOS 8
watchOS 8 debuts additional watch faces designed specially for the larger display on Apple Watch Series 7. The new Contour face takes the dial right to the edge of the display and fluidly animates throughout the day, emphasizing the current hour. The new Modular Duo face leverages the extra screen area with two large, data-rich center complications. Separately, the classic World Time face, based on heritage watches and ideal for travelers, tracks the time in 24 time zones around a double dial, and is available on Apple Watch Series 4 and later. The Portraits face uses the depth capabilities of iPhone Portrait mode to compose a beautiful, personalized experience.
The new Mindfulness app, sleep respiratory rate tracking, and Tai Chi and Pilates workout types can help improve overall wellness. New Wallet and Home app functionality provide more convenient access to the car and places users live, work, and visit. Enhancements to Messages and the Photos app make staying connected to loved ones even easier.
Cycling, Workout, and Fall Detection Updates
watchOS 8 also brings new features to anyone who rides a bike. Apple Watch uses advanced algorithms to analyze GPS, heart rate, accelerometer, and gyroscope data to detect when users begin a ride, and prompts them to start an Outdoor Cycle workout if one was not initiated.6As with all automatic Workout reminders, cyclists will see their metrics from when they first started their workout. Additionally, cycling workouts have auto-pause and resume, so metrics more accurately reflect time spent moving versus stationary, like waiting at a stoplight.
Apple Watch can more accurately measure active calories when riding an e-bike, with an updated cycling workout algorithm that evaluates GPS and heart rate to better determine when users are riding with pedal-assist versus leg power alone. New voice feedback through the built-in speaker of Apple Watch, or through AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones, will also automatically announce workout milestones and Activity ring status, helping users stay focused during activities like running or HIIT.
Since its launch in 2018, fall detection on Apple Watch has proven to be a valuable safety tool, recognizing if a user is immobile for approximately one minute if a hard fall is detected, and initiating a call to emergency services right from the wrist. With watchOS 8, fall detection algorithms are updated and optimized for detecting falls during workouts — including cycling — and have been tuned to recognize the unique motion and impact of falls from a bike and other workout types.7
Apple Watch Lineup
The Apple Watch Series 7 collection unveils five brand new aluminum case colors, including midnight, starlight, green, and a new blue and (PRODUCT)RED, along with an exciting palette of Apple Watch bands compatible with all models of Apple Watch. Additionally, Apple Watch Series 7 offers backward compatibility with previously released Apple Watch bands. Stainless steel models, Apple Watch Edition, Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Series 3 continue in existing colors.
Apple Watch Nike and Apple Watch Hermès also introduce exclusive new bands and watch faces this fall. The refreshed Nike Sport Loop comes in three colors, and features the Nike Swoosh and logo text incorporated into the weave of the band, pairing smartly with the new Nike Bounce watch face, which dynamically animates with the tap of the screen, scroll of the Digital Crown, or move of the wrist.
In addition to the vibrant color updates across the Classic, Attelage, and Jumping styles, Apple Watch Hermès introduces two new styles. Circuit H is a bold graphic representation of a signature anchor chain design, printed in Swift leather with a complementary watch face, and the Gourmette Double Tour pays homage to 1930s Hermès collars, with links weaving fluidly together in supple Fauve Barénia leather. This band wraps gracefully twice around the wrist and is an iconic representation of the recurring chain motif.
Apple Fitness+
On Monday, September 27,Apple Fitness+, the first fitness service built entirely around Apple Watch, will introduce a new body-conditioning workout type with Pilates and a simple way to practice mindfulness anywhere, anytime, with guided Meditation. Fitness+ is also introducing a new program called Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season, featuring two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time world champion skier Ted Ligety, along with Fitness+ trainer Anja Garcia. Later this fall, Fitness+ will introduce Group Workouts with SharePlay, where users can work out with up to 32 people at once to keep each other motivated.
Later this year, Fitness+ will be expanding to 15 new countries — Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates — where it will be available in English with subtitles in six languages, so more people around the world can experience the workouts led by a diverse and inclusive team of trainers whose approach is welcoming to all.
Apple Watch and the Environment
In line with Apple’s commitment to the environment, Apple Watch Series 7 has more recycled content than any other Apple Watch, featuring 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, including in the Taptic Engine; nearly 100 percent recycled tungsten throughout the product; and a 100 percent recycled case on aluminum models. Apple Watch Series 7 is also made without harmful chemicals like mercury, PVC, beryllium, and BFRs.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Fitness+ welcomes people at every fitness level to train their bodies and minds with Meditation and new workouts available September 27
Fitness+ will also be available in 15 new countries later this year
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced thatApple Fitness+, the first fitness service built entirely around Apple Watch, will introduce guided Meditation, a simple way to practice mindfulness anywhere, anytime, and Pilates, a new low-impact, body-conditioning workout type, on September 27. Fitness+ is also introducing a new program — Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season — featuring and designed with two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time world champion skier Ted Ligety, along with Fitness+ trainer Anja Garcia. Inspired by winter sports, the program will help build strength, balance, and endurance so users can have more fun on the slopes, all the way to the last run.
Later this fall, Fitness+ will introduce Group Workouts with SharePlay, where users can work out with up to 32 people at once to keep each other motivated. And later this year, Fitness+ will be available in 15 new countries with the addition of Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates. Fitness+ will be available in English with subtitles in six languages, so more people can experience the workouts led by a diverse and inclusive team of trainers whose approach is tailored to every body at every fitness level.
“Whether you’re just getting started, trying something new, or switching up how you train your mind and body, the amazing and welcoming Fitness+ trainer team is here to help users live a healthy lifestyle, no matter where they are in their fitness journey,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s senior director of Fitness Technologies. “We are excited to be introducing new workouts that bring Fitness+ users more options to stay active and motivated, plus immersive guided Meditation experiences that are approachable for all and easy to fit into your day. With new ways to work out together or alone — and coming to more countries later this year — we can’t wait to welcome even more people to experience Fitness+.”
Guided Meditation
Meditation can help users reduce everyday stress, develop a greater sense of awareness, and build resilience to face life’s challenges. Building on the popularity of Mindful Cooldowns in Fitness+, guided Meditation will help users develop a regular meditation routine and improve their overall sense of well-being. Users will be able to choose from nine guided Meditation themes — Purpose, Kindness, Gratitude, Awareness, Creativity, Wisdom, Calm, Focus, and Resilience — for an engaging video experience alongside the Fitness+ trainers. Each practice will be five, 10, or 20 minutes long.
In addition to the high-quality video experience on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, the same meditations will be uploaded each week in audio form in the new Mindfulness app on Apple Watch, so users can experience guided Meditation at their convenience anytime, anywhere. With watchOS 8, the Breathe app becomes the Mindfulness app, featuring an enhanced Breathe experience, a new session type called Reflect, and Fitness+ guided Meditations. These new audio meditations in Fitness+ can be played directly from Apple Watch when paired with AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones. Users who want to practice meditation while moving will also be able to track their activity with the Workout app on their Apple Watch while doing their meditation, allowing them to meditate while walking, hiking, or stretching.
Guided Meditation will be led by a group of Mindful Cooldown and Yoga trainers that Fitness+ users know and love, including Dustin Brown, Gregg Cook, Jessica Skye, and Jonelle Lewis, as well as two new trainers specializing in Meditation, Christian Howard and JoAnna Hardy. Christian and JoAnna have a combined 40 years of experience teaching both traditional and insight meditation in a personal and inclusive way. The guided Meditation trainers will offer a variety of experiences with different styles and approaches that are welcoming to all, whether it’s a person’s first practice or they are a seasoned expert. For those just getting started, a new Meditation for Beginners program will help users understand the fundamentals before diving into the studio sessions.
Pilates
Body-conditioning workouts like Strength, Core, and Yoga are among the most popular workouts in Fitness+. Pilates will now be added to Fitness+ as a new low-impact workout type, providing users with more options for maintaining and improving their strength and flexibility. Most Fitness+ Pilates workouts can be done with just a mat, while some also incorporate the use of a resistance band. All Pilates workouts will be 10, 20, or 30 minutes long.
Pilates will be led by two new Fitness+ trainers, Marimba Gold-Watts and Darryl Whiting. Marimba is an award-winning Pilates trainer who started her career as a professional dancer, and Darryl is a former professional athlete who brings an athletic approach to his Pilates workouts. Both trainers bring a broad range of styles to Pilates for Fitness+ users, making Pilates approachable to everyone who tries it. As with all Fitness+ studio workouts, Marimba and Darryl will be joined by members of the Fitness+ trainer team to show modifications for those who are just getting started, need a different option for specific moves, or are ready to try more advanced moves.
Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season
Over 100 million skiers and snowboarders around the world hit the slopes each year to enjoy being outdoors, get some exercise, and spend time with family and friends. To prepare users to get back to their favorite winter sports, Fitness+ is now introducing Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season, featuring and designed with two-time Olympic gold medalist and five-time world champion Ted Ligety, who is recognized as one of the world’s best alpine skiers, along with Fitness+ trainer Anja Garcia, who is an experienced snowboarder. These studio workouts are a fun way to build up strength, improve balance, and increase endurance — all important components to preventing injury. The program’s moves are inspired by exercises Ted adapted from his training program as an elite athlete, and include HIIT, Strength, Yoga, and Core. As with all Fitness+ studio workouts, modifications are shown so users can enjoy the workouts at their own level.
“I spent the last 17 years of my life training as a professional athlete, and now more than ever, I know how important it is to continue training in an accessible and realistic way so I can stay on the slopes longer, prevent injury, and have fun with my family,” said Ligety. “I hope people enjoy the workouts Anja and I put together, with some moves inspired by how I used to train as a professional athlete, and some that reflect life as a dad, carrying my kids’ skis, my skis, and my kids through the parking lot. This program is about fitness, but it’s also about finding ways to bring fitness into the areas of life that you enjoy the most.”
Fitness+ previously introduced workouts designed to help users reach their goals during a specific season of life — like Workouts for Pregnancy and Workouts for Older Adults — or a specific moment in their fitness journey — like Workouts for Beginners. The programs are intended to provide users with an important foundation for living a healthy lifestyle beyond a single workout.
Artist Spotlight and Time to Walk
Fitness+ will add to the popular Artist Spotlight series with new workouts featuring the music of Billie Eilish, Calvin Harris, Imagine Dragons, and Nicki Minaj. The Artist Spotlight series dedicates an entire workout playlist to a single artist. Every Monday for four weeks, new workouts featuring music by each of these artists will appear in the service across different modalities. Workout types include Cycling, Rowing, HIIT, Strength, Yoga, Dance, and Treadmill, across music genres such as Latest Hits, Chill Vibes, Everything Rock, Pure Dance, Upbeat Anthems, and Hip-Hop/R&B.
Inspired by these Fitness+ workouts, Apple Music and Apple One subscribers can enjoy the Fitness+ Spotlight series, which includes a unique playlist for each individual Artist Spotlight musician, including motivating, high-energy tracks from their entire catalogs, as well as collaborations and remixes for motivation outside of their Fitness+ workouts.
Throughout the fall, Fitness+ will also introduce new episodes of Time to Walk, an inspiring audio experience on Apple Watch designed to encourage Fitness+ users to get active by walking more often. Time to Walk features some of the world’s most interesting and influential people, who share stories, photos, and music with Fitness+ subscribers. As the series continues its second season, new guests will be added each week, including singer-songwriter Bebe Rexha; singer-songwriter Camila Cabello; country musician and actor Reba McEntire; activist and founder of the Me Too movement Tarana Burke; professional basketball player and 10-time NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony; and actor, activist, and author Gabrielle Union.
Group Workouts with SharePlay
Training with friends and family is a great way to stay motivated and accountable on your fitness journey. Later this fall, Group Workouts powered by SharePlay will come to Fitness+, with support for up to 32 people at a time. Users will be able to start a Group Workout from a group message thread or FaceTime call on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV with AirPlay. From there, they will navigate to the Fitness app, select a workout or Meditation, see their friends and family onscreen, and get started. During a Group Workout, users will see their metrics and progress toward closing their Activity rings, while also seeing and hearing friends as they work out. With Group Workouts, when someone moves ahead on the Burn Bar or closes their Activity ring, users will be notified so they can celebrate together — or even trade some friendly smack talk to keep each other going.
Apple Fitness+
Fitness+ is the first fitness service built entirely around Apple Watch. It brings studio-style workouts and guided Meditations to iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, led by a diverse and inclusive team of trainers whose approach is welcoming to all. Fitness+ intelligently incorporates workout metrics from Apple Watch for a first-of-its-kind personalized and immersive experience users can complete wherever and whenever is convenient for them, and workouts are fueled by inspiring music from today’s top artists designed to keep users motivated from start to finish.
Regardless of a person’s season of life or specific point in a person’s fitness journey, Fitness+ has targeted workout programs like Workouts for Pregnancy, Workouts for Older Adults, Workouts for Beginners, and Workouts to Get Ready for Snow Season that keep users moving and prepare them to live a healthier lifestyle. Fitness+ will also feature Meditations for Beginners to help users who are new to meditation get started. With Fitness+, users can also get moving outside with Time to Walk — the inspiring audio experience on Apple Watch for Fitness+ — designed to encourage users to get active by walking more often. Each episode features some of the world’s most interesting and influential people, who share stories, photos, and music with Fitness+ subscribers.

Apple unveils iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max — more pro than ever before
The most advanced pro camera system ever on iPhone; Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion; a massive leap in battery life; A15 Bionic, the fastest chip in a smartphone; an advanced 5G experience; and so much more
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducediPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in a smartphone. Redesigned inside and out, both models introduce an all-new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion featuring an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, making the touch experience faster and more responsive. The pro camera system gets its biggest advancement ever with new Ultra Wide, Wide, and Telephoto cameras that capture stunning photos and video, powered by the unmatched performance of A15 Bionic, more powerful than the leading competition. These technologies enable impressive new photo capabilities never before possible on iPhone, like macro photography on the new Ultra Wide camera and up to 2.2x improved low-light performance on the new Wide camera. New computational photography features like Photographic Styles personalize the look of images in the Camera app, and both models now include Night mode on all cameras. Video takes a huge leap forward with Cinematic mode for beautiful depth-of-field transitions, macro video, Time-lapse and Slo-mo, and even better low-light performance. Both models also offer end-to-end pro workflows in Dolby Vision, and for the first time, ProRes, only available on iPhone. iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max also include 5G with more bands for better coverage, big improvements to battery life for the best battery life ever on iPhone with iPhone 13 Pro Max, new storage capacity of 1TB, and the Ceramic Shield front cover, tougher than any smartphone glass.
iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max will be available in four stunning finishes, including graphite, gold, silver, and the all-new sierra blue. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 17, with availability beginning Friday, September 24.
“iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max make up our most pro iPhone lineup ever with the biggest advancement for our camera system, the best battery life ever in an iPhone, and the fastest performance of any smartphone, setting a new standard for iPhone and enabling incredible experiences never before possible,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “The new pro camera system offers even more pro photography capabilities like improved telephoto zoom, macro photography, Photographic Styles, Cinematic mode, as well as ProRes and Dolby Vision video. The Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion is our best display ever; it intelligently responds to the content on your screen, offers fantastic graphics performance, and is perfect for any viewing experience.”
The Most Advanced Cameras Ever on iPhone
With new sensors and lenses for all three rear cameras, optimized to work seamlessly with iOS 15 and powered by the new image signal processor (ISP) in A15 Bionic for improved noise reduction and tone mapping, the iPhone 13 Pro lineup features the best camera system ever on iPhone. The all-new Wide camera has a larger sensor with 1.9 µm pixels, the largest ever on iPhone, for less noise and faster shutter speeds needed across lighting conditions, producing even more detailed photos. Coupled with the larger ƒ/1.5 aperture, the Wide camera on iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max offers a massive improvement in low-light situations, up to 2.2x when compared to iPhone 12 Pro, and nearly 1.5x when compared to iPhone 12 Pro Max. Sensor-shift optical image stabilization (OIS) — unique to iPhone — is available on both models, stabilizing the sensor instead of the lens, so images are smooth and video is steady, even when the user is not.
The new Ultra Wide camera features a much wider ƒ/1.8 aperture and a new autofocus system, bringing a 92 percent improvement for low-light environments, producing images that are brighter and sharper. The new lens design, autofocus capability for the first time in the Ultra Wide on iPhone, and advanced software also unlock something never before possible on iPhone: macro photography. Users can capture sharp, stunning images where objects appear larger than life, magnifying subjects with a minimum focus distance of 2 centimeters. Macro also extends to video including Slo-mo and Time-lapse. iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max also boast a new 77 mm Telephoto camera, allowing users to get closer to their subjects while recording video and achieve even more classically framed portraits, offering 3x optical zoom for a total 6x optical zoom range on the camera system.
A faster Neural Engine in A15 Bionic, new ISP, and advancements in computational photography power the all-new camera features on iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Photographic Styles allows users to bring their personal photo preferences to every image while still benefitting from Apple’s multiframe image processing. Preset and customized preferences work across scenes and subjects, and unlike a simple filter, intelligently apply the right adjustments to different parts of the photo to ensure the important elements, like skin tones, are preserved. For the first time ever, Night mode comes to all cameras on iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max, including the Telephoto camera, and with Smart HDR 4, users can expect improved color, contrast, and lighting for subjects, even in group shots or challenging lighting situations, making images more true to life. iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max also offer popular features like Deep Fusion, Apple ProRAW, and Portrait mode with Portrait Lighting.
A Massive Leap in Smartphone Video
Following extensive study of cinematography and the powerful use of rack focus, Cinematic mode on iPhone records videos of people, pets, and objects with a beautiful depth effect with automatic focus changes, so anyone can capture cinema-style moments, even if they aren’t a professional filmmaker. For creative control, the focus can be changed during and after capture, and users can also adjust the level of bokeh in the Photos app and iMovie for iOS, and coming soon to iMovie for macOS and Final Cut Pro,1making the lineup the only devices able to edit the depth-of-field effect in video even after recording. Enabled by A15 Bionic and advanced machine learning algorithms, Cinematic mode records in Dolby Vision HDR.
iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max also introduce ProRes,2an advanced video codec used widely as the final delivery format for commercials, feature films, and broadcasts, to offer higher color fidelity and less compression.3This powerful new pro workflow is enabled by the new camera hardware, advanced video encoders and decoders in A15 Bionic, and flash storage pipeline. iPhone is the only smartphone in the world to provide an end-to-end workflow — capture, edit, and share in Dolby Vision or ProRes.
A15 Bionic with 5-core GPU for Best-in-Class Performance
A15 Bionic in the iPhone 13 Pro lineup is even more advanced, offering impressive power and efficiency, and driving the incredible new display, camera, and video features never before possible on iPhone. With 5-nanometer technology, A15 Bionic — the fastest chip in a smartphone — features a new 5-core GPU in the Pro lineup that brings the fastest graphics performance in any smartphone, up to 50 percent faster than the leading competition, ideal for video apps, high-performance gaming, and the slate of new camera features. The new 6-core CPU with two new high-performance cores and four new high-efficiency cores, is up to 50 percent faster than the competition and handles demanding tasks smoothly and efficiently. A new 16-core Neural Engine capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second enables even faster machine learning computations for third-party app experiences, as well as features like Live Text in Camera with iOS 15. And major advancements to the next-generation ISP provide improved noise reduction and tone mapping.
Super Retina XDR with ProMotion: A Brighter, More Responsive Display
iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max introduce the most advanced display ever on iPhone, Super Retina XDR with ProMotion, supporting an adaptive refresh rate from 10Hz to 120Hz, for fast frame rates when users need it and preserving battery life when they don’t.

The Most Advanced Dual-Camera System in iPhone
iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini represent a massive leap in camera design with advancements in hardware and computational photography that deliver stunning photos and videos. The new Wide camera, with 1.7 µm pixels, comes with the biggest sensor ever in an iPhone dual-camera system and is capable of gathering 47 percent more light for less noise and brighter results. Sensor-shift OIS — a technology introduced in iPhone 12 Pro Max and not found in any other smartphone — also comes to the Wide camera, even in the more compact iPhone 13 mini. It stabilizes the sensor instead of the lens so shots are more steady, while the custom-designed Ultra Wide camera with a new sensor captures images with more detail in the dark areas of photos and videos with less noise.
Following extensive study of cinematography and the powerful use of rack focus, Cinematic mode on iPhone records videos of people, pets, and objects with a beautiful depth effect with automatic focus changes, so anyone can capture cinema-style moments, even if they aren’t a professional filmmaker. For creative control, the focus can be changed during and after capture, and users can also adjust the level of bokeh in the Photos app and iMovie for iOS, and coming soon to iMovie for macOS and Final Cut Pro,5making the iPhone 13 lineup the only devices able to edit the depth-of-field effect in video even after recording. Enabled by A15 Bionic and advanced machine learning algorithms, Cinematic mode records in Dolby Vision HDR. Both models also offer HDR video recording with Dolby Vision — from capture to editing and sharing — now supported for 4K up to 60 fps on all cameras.
A faster Neural Engine in A15 Bionic, new image signal processor (ISP), and advancements in computational photography power all-new features on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini. Photographic Styles allows users to bring their personal photo preferences to every image while still benefitting from Apple’s multiframe image processing. Preset and customized preferences work across scenes and subjects, and unlike a simple filter, intelligently apply the right adjustments to different parts of the photo to ensure the important elements, like skin tones, are preserved. The dual-camera system and power of computational photography support Smart HDR 4, now with improved color, contrast, and lighting for each subject in a group photo, including in challenging conditions, making images more true to life, as well as improved Night mode. And the TrueDepth camera supports all the amazing new camera features, including Cinematic mode, Photographic Styles, Smart HDR 4, and more.
A15 Bionic: The Engine of iPhone 13
A15 Bionic is much faster than the competition, delivering more performance and better power efficiency, making everything even more fluid in the iPhone 13 lineup. It uses 5-nanometer technology and has nearly 15 billion transistors to tackle the most demanding tasks, including the latest computational photography features. A new 6-core CPU with two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores is up to 50 percent faster than the competition, the fastest in any smartphone, and handles demanding tasks smoothly and efficiently, while the new 4-core GPU is up to 30 percent faster than the competition and enables more lifelike visuals and lighting effects in graphics-intensive games. The new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for third-party app experiences, as well as features like Live Text in Camera with iOS 15. Major advancements to the next-generation ISP, paired with computational photography and powerful camera hardware, combine to create the new dual-camera system.
5G Experiences in More Places
The world is quickly moving to 5G, and iPhone offers an advanced 5G experience, transforming the way users connect, share, and enjoy content. The customized hardware design in the iPhone 13 lineup features more 5G bands, allowing it to work in more places on 5G for greater coverage and performance.6By the end of 2021, support for 5G on iPhone will double around the globe, with over 200 carriers worldwide in 60 countries and regions.

September 20, 2021
UPDATE
iOS 15 is available today
iOS 15 introduces new ways to stay connected, powerful updates that help users focus and explore, and intelligent features to get more done with iPhone. FaceTime updates provide more natural video calls, Focus helps users reduce distraction, new features like Live Text use on-device intelligence to surface useful information, upgrades to Maps provide brand new ways to navigate the world, and much more.iOS 15is available today as a free software update.
Enhancements for More Natural FaceTime Calls
FaceTime is more essential than ever, giving users a way to easily connect with the people who matter most. Powerful updates to FaceTime audio and video features make calls feel more natural and lifelike. With spatial audio, voices in a Group FaceTime call sound like they’re coming from the direction in which the person is positioned on the screen.1Voice Isolation, a new microphone mode, uses machine learning to eliminate background noise and prioritize the user’s voice, while Wide Spectrum allows for every bit of background sound to come through. Inspired by the stunning portrait photos taken on iPhone, Portrait mode in FaceTime blurs a user’s background and puts them at the focus.2Voice Isolation, Wide Spectrum, and Portrait mode can also be used with third-party apps, such as Webex, Zoom, and WhatsApp. Group FaceTime gives the option to display participants in same-size tiles in a new grid view.
FaceTime calls now extend beyond Apple devices, so people using an Android or Windows device can join from their web browser. FaceTime calls on the web remain end-to-end encrypted so privacy is not compromised. To initiate the call, iPhone, iPad, and Mac users simply create a FaceTime link and share it through Messages, Calendar, Mail, or third-party apps, making it easier than ever to connect with friends and family.
Later this fall, SharePlay will deliver a new way for users to share experiences with friends and family while on a FaceTime call, such as listening to songs together, watching a TV show or movie, completing a workout together, or sharing their screen to view apps. SharePlay will work with apps like Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Fitness+, as well as Disney+, ESPN+, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+, Pluto TV, SoundCloud, TikTok, Twitch, and many others. SharePlay can be accessed through iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and with shared playback controls, anyone in a SharePlay session can play, pause, or jump ahead. SharePlay even extends to Apple TV, so users can watch shows or movies on a big screen.
More Ways to Stay Connected with Messages
Shared with You is a new section that appears in Photos, Safari, Apple News, Music, Apple Podcasts, and the Apple TV app that displays the photos, articles, music, and other content shared by friends and family in Messages. Shared with You automatically displays shared photos in the Photos app, news stories in Apple News, and other relevant content in the corresponding app. The Shared with You section shows who sent the content, and makes it easy to view the associated message and restart the conversation.
In iOS 15, Memoji brings even more ways for users to express themselves with multicolored headwear, more glasses styles, and new accessibility options including cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and a soft helmet. Memoji stickers can be customized with more than 40 outfit options and nine new sticker poses including a shaka, hand wave, and light bulb moment.
Powerful Tools to Find Focus in the Day
iOS 15 introduces Focus, a new way to help users reduce distraction by filtering notifications based on what a user wants to focus on in that moment. For example, the Work Focus can be set during work hours to only allow notifications from coworkers and apps that are used for work, the Personal Focus can be used when taking a break with friends and family, or the Fitness Focus can help a user stay in the zone while completing a workout. Users can create a custom Focus or select a provided Focus, which uses on-device intelligence to suggest which notifications from people and apps are allowed. To further extend the ability to focus, users can create dedicated Home Screen pages with relevant apps and widgets to match a specific Focus.
While using Focus, a status is automatically displayed to contacts in Messages and supported third-party communication apps like Slack, so they know not to interrupt. Users will even receive suggestions to turn on a Focus based on factors like time of day or location, and when Focus is set on one Apple device, it automatically applies to all of a user’s Apple devices.
A Fresh New Look for Notifications
Notifications have been redesigned, adding contact photos for people and larger icons for apps that make them even easier to identify. The notification summary is a collection of notifications delivered each day at scheduled times determined by the user. Using on-device intelligence, the summary is arranged by priority, with the most relevant notifications rising to the top based on how a user interacts with apps. Time-sensitive notifications, messages, and phone calls will be delivered immediately, so users won’t miss timely alerts, and it’s easy to temporarily mute any app or messaging thread for an hour or for the day.
On-Device Intelligence Delivers Live Text, Advanced Spotlight Search, and Memories
Live Text makes text in photos interactive. Using on-device intelligence, Live Text recognizes text in photos across the entire system including the web, and allows users to take action, such as copy and paste, look up information, and translate. Users can even tap the image of a phone number to make a call, or the image of a web address to open a page in Safari. With the power of the Neural Engine, the Camera app can also quickly recognize and copy text in the moment, such as the Wi-Fi password displayed at a local coffee shop. With Visual Look Up, users can learn more about popular art, landmarks, and books, plants and flowers found in nature, and breeds of pets.
Spotlight is the universal way to start searches on iPhone and now it can be accessed directly from the Lock Screen, and includes the ability to search photos by location, people, scenes, or objects. Using Live Text, Spotlight can find text and handwriting in photos.
iOS 15 delivers the biggest update ever to Memories. With a fresh new look, interactive interface, and integration with Apple Music that uses on-device intelligence to suggest music tracks, new cinematic Memories makes it easier to relive favorite or forgotten moments.
Redesigned Browsing with Safari
Safari introduces a newly designed browsing experience that makes controls easier to reach. By default, the new tab bar is positioned at the bottom of the screen, so users can easily swipe between tabs with one hand. Tab Groups allow users to organize tabs and easily access them at any time across iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and a customizable start page and web extensions on iOS make Safari more powerful and personal than ever.
Navigate and Explore with Apple Maps
Maps in iOS 15 introduces a whole new way of looking at the world. A visually stunning map offers unprecedented levels of detail for neighborhoods, commercial districts, buildings, as well as custom-designed landmarks, and a new night-time mode with a moonlit glow. Navigation features a new three-dimensional driving view with road details that help users more easily identify turn lanes, medians, crosswalks, and sidewalks. The enhanced map is available in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, with more to come. A beautifully designed interactive globe provides rich detail for mountain ranges, deserts, rainforests, and bodies of water.
Transit riders can get one-tap access to all departures near them and pin their favorite lines. Maps automatically follows along with a selected transit route, notifying users when it’s nearly time to disembark, and riders can even keep track on Apple Watch. By simply holding up iPhone, users can receive detailed walking directions in augmented reality.
New Keys and State IDs Come to Apple Wallet
With iOS 15, users can access even more places with just a tap of their iPhone with new home, hotel, office, and car keys in Wallet. Digital car keys get even better with support for Ultra Wideband technology, so users can securely lock, unlock, and start their supported vehicle without removing their iPhone from a pocket or bag.3iPhone can also be used to unlock a user’s home, office, or even a hotel room — all through keys stored in Wallet.4Additionally, users will be able to add eligible state IDs and driver’s licenses to Wallet on iPhone as this option becomes available in their state in the future.5
Redesigned Weather Experience
Weather includes an all-new design with full-screen maps, graphical displays of weather data, and dynamic layouts that change based on conditions. Beautifully animated backgrounds more accurately reflect sun position, clouds, and precipitation, and notifications indicate when rain or snow is about to start or stop.
Organize and Collaborate in Notes
Notes adds user-created tags that make it easy to quickly categorize notes and mentions that allow members of shared notes to notify one another of important updates. An all-new Activity view shows the recent history of a shared note, and Highlights reveals details on who made the changes. Quick Notes created on Mac and iPad can be viewed and edited in Notes.
More Privacy Controls
New privacy features provide even more transparency and control over the data users provide to apps. Mail Privacy Protection prevents senders from learning whether an email has been opened, and hides IP addresses so senders can’t learn a user’s location or use it to build a profile on them. Siri’s protection of user privacy goes even further with on-device speech recognition as users’ audio requests are now processed entirely on device by default, enabling more personalization, offline requests, and faster performance.6
Additional Features
Pricing and Availability
iOS 15 is a free software update that is available starting today for iPhone 6s and later. For more information, visitapple.com/ios/ios-15. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages.

UPDATE
iPadOS 15 is available today
iPadOS 15 introduces new features that take the versatility of iPad even further, with a multitasking experience that is even more intuitive, new widget layouts for the Home Screen, the App Library, more ways to capture thoughts with Quick Note, and FaceTime updates for more natural video calls.iPadOS 15is available today as a free software update.
Get More Done with Multitasking and Keyboard Shortcuts
iPadOS 15 makes working with multiple apps easier than ever. A new multitasking menu appears at the top of apps, making it easy to go into Split View or Slide Over with just a tap. Users now have quick access to the Home Screen when using Split View, and using the new shelf, they can also multitask with apps that have multiple windows like Safari and Pages.
All-new keyboard shortcuts and a redesigned menu bar allow users to get more done, including quickly setting up and switching between Split View and Slide Over right from their external keyboard.
Organize and Personalize iPad with Widgets and the App Library
Widgets can now be placed among apps on the Home Screen, providing more information at a glance and offering a more personalized experience. A new larger widget size, designed specifically for the larger display of iPad, is perfect for showcasing videos, music, games, photos, and more.
The App Library also comes to iPad, which automatically organizes all apps into helpful categories like Productivity, Games, and Recently Added, and is easily accessible right from the Dock.
Capture Thoughts with Quick Note and Organize with Tags
Notes goes systemwide with Quick Note, a fast way to take notes anywhere across iPadOS. Whether browsing in Safari or searching for a restaurant on Yelp, users can bring up Quick Note to jot down a thought and save links, providing an easy way to get back to exactly what they were viewing.
Notes also offers new ways to organize and collaborate. Tags make it easy to categorize notes and find them quickly with an all-new Tag Browser and tag-based Smart Folders. When working in shared notes, mentions allow members to notify one another and link them back to the note, and a new Activity view shows recent updates in the note.
Enhancements for More Natural FaceTime Calls
Powerful updates to FaceTime audio and video make calls more natural and lifelike. With spatial audio, voices in a FaceTime call sound like they’re coming from the direction in which the person is positioned on the screen. Voice Isolation, a new microphone mode, uses machine learning to eliminate background noise and prioritize the user’s voice, while Wide Spectrum allows for every bit of background sound to come through.
Portrait mode in FaceTime blurs a user’s background and puts them in focus, and Group FaceTime now gives the option to display participants in same-size tiles in a new grid view, making it easier to have conversations with larger groups.
Also new in iPadOS 15, FaceTime calls can now extend to Android and Windows devices. Users can create a link from iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and share it through Messages, Calendar, Mail, or third-party apps, so anyone can join a FaceTime call from their web browser. FaceTime calls on the web remain end-to-end encrypted, so privacy is not compromised.
Later this fall, SharePlay will deliver a new way for users to share experiences with friends and family while on a FaceTime call, such as listening to songs together, watching a TV show or movie, completing a workout together, or sharing their screen to view apps. SharePlay will work with apps like Apple Music, Apple TV+, and Apple Fitness+, as well as Disney+, ESPN+, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Paramount+, Pluto TV, SoundCloud, TikTok, Twitch, and many others. SharePlay can be accessed through iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and with shared playback controls, anyone in a SharePlay session can play, pause, or jump ahead. SharePlay even extends to Apple TV, so users can watch shows or movies on a big screen.
Tools to Find Focus and a Fresh New Look for Notifications
iPadOS 15 introduces Focus, a new way to help users reduce distraction by filtering notifications based on what they want to focus on in that moment. For example, the Work focus can be set during work hours to only allow notifications from coworkers and apps that are used for work, and the Personal focus can be used when taking a break with friends and family. To reduce temptation, dedicated Home Screen pages can be created with relevant apps and widgets to match a specific Focus. While using Focus, a status is automatically displayed to contacts in Messages and supported third-party communication apps like Slack, so others know not to interrupt.
Notifications have been redesigned, adding contact photos for people and larger icons for apps that make them even easier to identify. Users can now receive a notification summary — a helpful collection of notifications delivered daily — at scheduled times, like in the morning and evening, making it easy to catch up on the day’s activity at their convenience.
On-Device Intelligence Powers New Photo Features and Advanced Spotlight Search
Using on-device intelligence, Live Text recognizes text in photos across the entire system including the web, and allows users to take action, such as copy and paste, look up information, and translate. Users can tap the image of a phone number to make a call, or the image of a web address to open a page in Safari.With Visual Look Up, users can learn more about popular art, landmarks, books, plants and flowers, and breeds of pets.
Spotlight now adds the ability to search the Photos app and web images, and has all-new rich results for contacts with context like recent conversations, shared photos, and their location if shared through Find My. Using Live Text, Spotlight can also find text and handwriting in photos.
Translate Comes to iPad with New Ways to Communicate
The Translate app comes to iPad with new features that make conversations easier and more natural. When using the Translate app, Auto Translate detects when someone is speaking, and in which language, so users can converse naturally without having to tap a microphone button. For even more personal conversations, face-to-face view allows two people to sit across from each other with iPad between them and see translations of the conversation from their own side. Text and handwriting can now be translated anywhere on iPad by selecting it and tapping Translate. And, in combination with Live Text, even text in photos can be translated.
More Privacy Controls
New privacy features go even further to provide transparency and control over the data users provide to apps. Mail Privacy Protection prevents senders from learning whether an email has been opened, and hides IP addresses so senders cannot learn a user’s location or use it to build a profile on them. Siri’s protection of user privacy goes even further with on-device speech recognition, as audio requests are now processed entirely on device by default.1This also enables more personalization, offline requests, and faster performance.

2021-09-20,Decrease,watchOS 8 is available today,"Text of this article
September 20, 2021
UPDATE
watchOS 8 is available today
New cycling and wellness features, fresh watch faces, more access with Wallet, and a redesigned Home app arrive for Apple Watch users
Apple today launchedwatchOS 8, bringing powerful features to help Apple Watch users stay connected, be more active, and better understand their overall health and wellness. New workout types, updates to cycling, and the new Mindfulness app expand support for physical and mental well-being, while enhanced capabilities with the Wallet and Home apps enable users to more seamlessly use Apple Watch on the go and at home. The redesigned Photos app, new watch faces, and tools in Messages provide customers with more ways to connect with loved ones.
Workout Updates
watchOS 8 introduces two new popular workout types that are beneficial for both physical fitness and mindful movement: Tai Chi and Pilates. These new workout types are supported by powerful, validated, custom-built heart rate and motion algorithms to provide users with accurate calorie metrics.
The update also adds new features for anyone who rides a bike. Apple Watch uses advanced algorithms to analyze GPS, heart rate, accelerometer, and gyroscope data to detect when users begin a ride, and prompts them to start an Outdoor Cycle workout if one was not initiated.1Cycling workouts now have auto-pause and resume so metrics more accurately reflect time spent moving versus stationary, like waiting at a stoplight.
Apple Watch more accurately measures active calories when riding an e-bike, with an updated cycling workout algorithm that evaluates GPS and heart rate data to better determine when users are riding with pedal-assist versus leg power alone. New voice feedback through the built-in speaker of Apple Watch, or through AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones, will automatically announce workout milestones and Activity ring status, helping users stay focused during activities like running or HIIT.
Fall Detection Update
With watchOS 8, fall detection algorithms are updated and optimized for detecting falls during workouts — including cycling — and have been tuned to recognize the unique motion and impact of falls from a bike and other workout types.2
A New Approach to Mindfulness
The Breathe app is now the Mindfulness app, featuring an enhanced Breathe experience; a new session type, Reflect; and guided Meditations for Fitness+ subscribers. Reflect offers a mindful intention to focus on for as little as a minute that can be done anywhere and at any time, and each session welcomes the user with a unique, thoughtful notion to consider that invites a positive frame of mind.
Starting Monday, September 27, new guided Meditations will be uploaded each week in audio form in the new Mindfulness app on Apple Watch for Fitness+ subscribers, in addition to being available as an immersive video experience on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. These can be played directly from Apple Watch when paired with AirPods or other Bluetooth headphones, so users can experience guided Meditation at their convenience. Users who want to practice meditation while moving will also be able to track their activity with the Workout app.
Sleeping Respiratory Rate
Apple Watch helps users meet their sleep goals by establishing a pre-bedtime routine, and tracks metrics like time asleep, heart rate, and blood oxygen. watchOS 8 provides users even more insight into their overall wellness by tracking sleeping respiratory rate — the number of breaths per minute. This information can be viewed, along with trends over time, in the Health app on iPhone.
More Access with Wallet
With watchOS 8, Wallet brings even more contact-free ways for users to access the places and things they care about seamlessly, safely, and securely. Ultra Wideband support arrives for digital car keys,3and Apple Watch users can securely unlock their car from a distance and start it from the driver’s seat. Additionally, users can add home and hotel keys as well as corporate badges to Wallet, and tap their Apple Watch to unlock.4
Beginning with Arizona and Georgia, and followed by Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah, users will be able to add their driver’s license or state ID to Wallet, and present it at select TSA checkpoints and lanes.5
Redesigned Home App
The redesigned Home app offers more convenient control for accessories and scenes, as well as the ability to control accessories by room. Users with a HomeKit-enabled camera can view who is at the door directly on their wrist. Apple Watch users can also tap Intercom to quickly broadcast a message throughout the home or to individual rooms via HomePod mini.
New Apple Watch Faces
The new Portraits watch face brings to life stunning portrait photos shot on iPhone with an immersive, multilayered effect, intelligently recognizing faces in photos and cropping in to highlight the subject. The classic World Time face, based on heritage watches and ideal for travelers, tracks the time in 24 time zones around a double dial.6
Messages
Communicating on Apple Watch is even easier with new tools in Messages. Users can combine the use of Scribble, dictation, and emoji all within the same message, and for dictated messages, they have the option to edit the presented text. To easily add even more expression to a message, users can simply enter a word or phrase and select from hundreds of trending GIFs.
Focus
Focus is a new way to help reduce distraction by filtering notifications from people and apps based on what a user is currently doing. Apple Watch automatically aligns with any Focus set on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. Users can set automations to turn on Focus at relevant times, like the Fitness Focus when starting a workout.

UPDATE
Apple Maps introduces new ways to explore major cities in 3D
Maps users in London, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco can experience a three-dimensional city view with rich detail, enhanced navigation, immersive walking directions, and more
With the release of iOS 15, Apple Maps gets its biggest update ever with a city experience that offers rich details, driving routes with better navigation, immersive walking directions shown in augmented reality, and much more. The update, which expands on the new map that Apple spent years building from the ground up, is now available in London, Los Angeles, New York City, and the San Francisco Bay Area, with more cities to come.
“We are thrilled to offer the new Apple Maps experience. Maps is the best way to navigate the world: It is easy to use, beautifully designed, and built with privacy at its core. With this update, we are pushing Maps even further, providing more ways for users to discover the natural beauty of the world and explore cities through a new 3D view,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “Our goal has always been to build the best and most accurate map in the world. The upgrades in Apple Maps are a continuation of that effort, with features and an attention to detail that only Apple can deliver.”
Explore Cities with Highly Detailed Maps
Apple Maps introduces a new way to navigate cities with a visually stunning 3D map that offers unprecedented detail for neighborhoods, commercial districts, marinas, buildings, and more. Now users can see elevation details across a city, new road labels, and hundreds of custom-designed landmarks like Coit Tower in San Francisco, Dodger Stadium in LA, the Statue of Liberty in NYC, and the Royal Albert Hall in London, with more to come. A beautiful nighttime mode with a moonlit glow activates at dusk. The city map experience is now available in London, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco, and later this year, it will be available in Philadelphia, San Diego, and Washington, D.C. Support for additional cities, including Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, will be available next year.
Enhanced Navigation Provides a Better Driving Experience
Maps now features even more road details to help drivers navigate through cities more easily and safely. Turn lanes, medians, bus and taxi lanes, and crosswalks are clearly displayed for navigating busy intersections, and highways with overlapping complex interchanges are rendered in a road-level 3D view, making it easier to see upcoming traffic conditions or the best lane for an approaching exit. Route planning provides the estimated time of arrival for future departures based on expected traffic. The new navigation will be available through CarPlay later this year.
Never Miss a Stop with Powerful Transit Updates
Maps now offers major improvements for public transit riders. Nearby stations are prominently displayed at the top of the screen, and users can pin their favorite lines in Maps so the best route is just one tap away. Once a transit route is selected, Maps will automatically notify a user when it is time to disembark as they approach their final destination, and riders can even keep track on Apple Watch. These updates build on transit features already available in Maps, including real-time transit, which provides detailed transit schedules, live departure times, arrival times, the current location of a bus or train en route, and system connections to help plan a journey. Maps also includes important real-time information like outages.
Immersive Walking Directions
With iOS 15, Apple Maps introduces step-by-step walking guidance in augmented reality. Users can simply raise their iPhone to scan buildings in the area, and Maps generates a highly accurate position to deliver detailed directions that can be viewed in the context of the real world.
Discover Great Places with Curated Guides
Maps makes it easy to discover the amazing things to see and do in cities around the world through curated Guides created by a selection of trusted resources. In iOS 15, users can tap the Explore Guides button in Maps to access over a thousand expertly curated guides that include recommendations from respected brands such as Time Out, The Washington Post, the National Park Foundation, Complex, and The Infatuation. Curated Guides can be saved, and they are automatically updated when new places are added, so users always have the latest recommendations. Users can even create their own personal Guides of favorite places to share with friends and family.
A New Interactive Globe
In iOS 15, Apple Maps offers a rich and interactive three-dimensional globe that introduces a whole new way of looking at the world. The globe shows Earth’s natural beauty with amazing textures and contours. Users can see vibrant details of mountain ranges, deserts, rainforests, oceans, and more. Now even the most remote and precious locations on the planet can be explored right from iPhone.
In addition to the new updates available in iOS 15, Apple Maps offers many useful features:
Maps and Privacy
Apple is committed to keeping personal information safe and has built privacy into the core of Maps. With Maps, no sign-in is required. Personalized features, such as suggesting departure time to make the next appointment, are created using on-device intelligence. Any data collected by Maps while using the app, including search terms, navigation routing, and traffic information, is associated with random identifiers that regularly reset to prevent connecting search and location data stored on the server to a unique user. Maps goes even further to obscure a user’s location on Apple servers when searching for a location through a process called “fuzzing.” Maps converts the precise location where the search originated to a less-exact one within 24 hours.
Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages.

PRESS RELEASE
New features in Keynote, Pages, and Numbers enhance remote presentations and working with documents on the go
Keynote adds new tools for collaborative presenting; Pages makes it easier to work with documents on iPhone; and Numbers brings pivot tables to iPhone, iPad, and Mac
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today updated itsiWorksuite of productivity apps with new features that enable users to present in powerful new ways and make it even easier to work with documents on the go. New tools in Keynote make presentations more engaging, with the ability to show a live camera view of the presenter directly in slides, and more collaborative with multi-presenter control. Pages makes it easier than ever to view and edit documents on the go by automatically displaying text and images in a single-column flow that is optimized for iPhone. And Numbers introduces pivot tables that bring powerful data analytics capabilities to iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
“Whether they are in the office, at school, or working remotely, users around the world love Keynote, Pages, and Numbers for their powerful features, ease of use, and seamless experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “Today, we’re adding even more power and capability to these apps with new productivity and collaboration features that enable anyone to create more personal and compelling presentations, make working with documents on iPhone a breeze, and bring full-featured pivot tables to mobile for the first time.”
New Ways to Present in Keynote
Powerful new tools make Keynote presentations more personal, engaging, and collaborative. With the option to use the front-facing camera on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, users can now add live video directly to their presentations. This allows the presenter to appear alongside the content in their slide — ideal for lectures, how-to videos, and remote presentations through video conferencing apps. Live video objects can be easily resized or styled with masks, frames, drop shadows, and reflections for a more elegant look. Mac users can connect multiple external cameras to further enhance the live video experience, and they can even show the screen of a connected iPhone or iPad right on a slide for live, interactive demos.

2021-10-05,Increase,Apple unveils new resources for elementary school coding and inclusive app design,"Text of this article
October 5, 2021
UPDATE
Apple unveils new resources for elementary school coding and inclusive app design
New Everyone Can Code Early Learners guide available today, as well as Inclusive App Design activity and updates to the Schoolwork app
Apple is unveiling new resources for elementary school students and educators, including a new activity guide, Everyone Can Code Early Learners, that extends its coding curriculum resources from kindergarten to college. Educators can also try Apple’s new one-hour Inclusive App Design activity to introduce students to the world of coding and app development. In addition, updates to the popular Schoolwork app include support for exit tickets and enable educators to use the app on their personal devices.
“Coding and app design are essential literacies — these skills help students think critically and creatively, regardless of whether they go on to be app developers,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Education and Enterprise Marketing. “Apple now offers coding resources for learners from kindergarten to college, and challenges them to design amazing apps that are inclusive and accessible to users. Our resources and support for educators are designed to prepare students to be the innovators of tomorrow, whether they’re just getting started or ready to build their first apps.”
Apple’s instructional designers work alongside educators to support teaching and learning with Swift, Apple’s powerful, open-source programming language used by professional developers to build the world’s most popular apps. As a supplemental new activity guide to Apple’s Everyone Can Code curriculum and the Swift Playgrounds app, Everyone Can Code Early Learners helps educators and families introduce coding to students in their early years, when learners are first developing computational thinking skills. Through engaging and often off-screen activities, learners in kindergarten through third grade will discuss, discover, and play to build a foundation in core coding concepts through subjects that include science, art, music, and physical education. For example, a lesson on coding commands is taught through dance moves, and an activity on functions asks students to discuss calming techniques step by step, connecting to social emotional learning.
“Learning the fundamentals of coding at a young age helps students listen, communicate, and think in new ways — and it improves students’ confidence,” said Leticia Batista, Ed.D., a dual-language kindergarten teacher at McKinna Elementary School in Oxnard, California. “Code brings students onto equal ground, no matter what language they speak at home, and helps build a strong community of problem solvers. I’m looking forward to introducing my students to Swift with the engaging, age-appropriate arts and movement activities in Everyone Can Code Early Learners.”
During Europe Code Week, October 9-24, and through Computer Science Education Week, December 6-12, Apple is encouraging educators and their students to participate in an introductory Inclusive App Design activity. This new lesson from Apple helps educators guide students through a one-hour session to turn their ideas into apps with inclusion and accessibility in mind. The app design process helps students identify problems they care about, and then plan, prototype, and code creative solutions. It helps students think critically about how to build apps that are inclusive for all and prepares them to be the innovators of tomorrow.
In addition, new updates coming to the Schoolwork app add support for a popular educator survey tool called exit tickets. Exit tickets are a quick way for teachers to check in with students during or after class, using easy-to-create questions to gauge student comprehension, reactions, or engagement. New enhancements to the Schoolwork setup experience give teachers the ability to create Schoolwork accounts for students with little to no IT involvement.
Everyone Can Code Early Learners is available today as a free download for families and educators onapple.co/code-early. In celebration of Europe Code Week, the guide is launching in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish, with additional languages to follow. The Inclusive App Design activity is available now in theApple Teacher Learning Center. The Schoolwork app is available in beta through AppleSeed for IT.

In addition to the fundamentals of coding, academy participants will learn design, marketing, project management, and more — with an emphasis on inclusivity and making a positive impact in their communities. Launched in collaboration with Michigan State University, the academy is part of Apple’sRacial Equity and Justice Initiative, an effort to address systemic racism and expand opportunities for communities of color across the country.
“We believe apps for everyone should be designed by everyone, and that all aspiring developers and entrepreneurs should have the opportunity to be a part of the thriving app economy,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’svice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Detroit has an incredible entrepreneurial spirit, powered by creativity and inclusion, and we’re thrilled to welcome this inaugural class of creators as we start classes at the Apple Developer Academy, the first of its kind in the US. Through the power of technology and innovation, we are proud to be helping prepare these innovators for new opportunities.”
The academy curriculum is designed to ensure graduates have the full suite of skills to find and create jobs in the iOS app economy, which supports over 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states and continues to provide new economic opportunities for developers and their teams.
The Detroit Apple Developer Academy’s first class is made up of a diverse group of 100 learners, aged 18 to 60, who will receive 10 months of comprehensive app development and entrepreneurial training, giving them the tools to create the next generation of cutting-edge apps. Enrollment is available at no cost, and students are not required to have any previous coding experience. Students in this year’s class bring a breadth of personal, professional, and academic experience to the program.
“Our goal is to create new pathways and new opportunities for a diverse group of 21st-century tech leaders, and we’re proud to be working with Apple to bring this vision to life,” said Sarah Gretter, Michigan State University’s lead of the Detroit Apple Developer Academy. “I’m inspired by our first class of students, and can’t wait to see where this journey takes them — whether it’s starting a new business, creating a new app, or developing marketable new skills.”
Located in a new, custom-designed space in the First National Building in downtown Detroit, the academy welcomes students in person to an environment created specifically to facilitate collaboration and engagement. The Gilbert Family Foundation, in partnership with Rocket Companies, provided a gift to Michigan State University in support of the Apple Developer Academy’s efforts in Detroit and will continue to contribute support to the academy as it grows and evolves.
Earlier this fall, the academy hosted a smaller cohort of community partners — including Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan, College for Creative Studies, and others — for a four-week Foundation course to introduce the basic concepts of coding. The academy is expected to eventually teach close to a thousand students each year through the Foundation and Academy programs.

MagSafe 3 makes connecting a charge cable quick and easy while protecting MacBook Pro. Additionally, fast charge comes to the Mac for the first time, charging up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. With M1 Pro, users can now connect up to two Pro Display XDRs, and with M1 Max, users can connect up to three Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV, all at the same time. For wireless connectivity, MacBook Pro also features Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0.
Best Camera and Audio Ever in a Mac Notebook
The new MacBook Pro comes with a 1080p FaceTime HD camera — the best ever in a Mac notebook — doubling resolution and low-light performance. The camera system taps into the powerful image signal processor (ISP) and Neural Engine of M1 Pro and M1 Max for computational video that enhances video quality — so users appear sharper with more natural-looking skin tones.
Delivering a next-level audio experience, the new MacBook Pro has industry-leading, studio-quality mics that have an even lower noise floor, resulting in clearer calls and voice recordings. A high-fidelity six-speaker sound system features two tweeters for a clearer soundstage and four force-cancelling woofers, resulting in 80 percent more bass. The sound system also supports spatial audio, which creates a sophisticated, three-dimensional listening experience. So whether users are listening to music or watching a movie in Dolby Atmos, they will get a theater-like experience. Altogether, this is the best audio system ever in a notebook.
macOS Monterey Optimized for M1 Pro and M1 Max
The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro come with macOS Monterey, the latest version of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system. The combination of macOS Monterey and the powerful new M1 Pro and M1 Max delivers breakthrough performance and productivity for users. FaceTime includes new audio and video features that make calls feel more natural and lifelike, and new Continuity tools like AirPlay to Mac enable Apple devices to work even better together. Live Text and Visual Lookup bring new intelligence features to surface useful information, Safari includes powerful tab organization with Tab Groups, and the ease of automation comes to the Mac with Shortcuts. Coming later this fall, SharePlay will enable Mac users to have shared experiences together through FaceTime, and Universal Control will make it easy for users to work effortlessly across their Mac and iPad.
With macOS Monterey and Apple silicon, Mac users can run a greater range of apps than ever before. All of Apple’s Mac apps are optimized for and run natively on M1 Pro and M1 Max, and there are over 10,000 Universal apps and plug-ins available, including Lightroom Classic, Cinema 4D, Capture One, and many more. Existing Mac apps that have not yet been updated to Universal will run seamlessly with Apple’s Rosetta 2 technology, and users can also run iPhone and iPad apps directly on the Mac, opening a huge new universe of possibilities. Powerful new features also come to Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, allowing creatives to take full advantage of the power and performance of M1 Pro and M1 Max.
Better for the Environment
When it comes to the environment, the new MacBook Pro raises the bar yet again, including an enclosure made with 100 percent recycled aluminum, 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of its main logic board, and, for the first time in a Mac notebook, the use of 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. Both models are also built with 35 percent or more recycled plastic in seven components, and all of the packaging wood fibers are from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. MacBook Pro remains free of harmful substances, is manufactured using even more renewable energy, and meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.

PRESS RELEASE
Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro updated with powerful new features and unprecedented performance on the all-new MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max
Final Cut Pro delivers huge advances in 8K video performance; Logic Pro features a complete set of tools for creating music in spatial audio
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today updatedFinal Cut ProandLogic Prowith powerful new features for creative professionals, and optimizations that take full advantage of the power and performance of the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips in the all-new MacBook Pro. Professional video editors using Final Cut Pro on the new MacBook Pro can perform tasks never before possible on a Mac, like the ability to play seven streams of 8K ProRes or color grade 8K HDR video with the new Liquid Retina XDR display — a first for any notebook. Final Cut Pro also introduces a new Object Tracker that uses machine learning to automatically detect faces and objects, and match their movement to create beautiful, cinema-quality titles and effects on any Mac. Logic Pro, Apple’s pro music creation software, now comes with a complete set of tools for authoring spatial audio music — allowing anyone to mix and export their songs in Dolby Atmos for Apple Music. And musicians can use up to 3x as many plug-ins for recording on the all-new MacBook Pro with M1 Max. Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro are Universal apps that build upon the breakthrough performance and pro capabilities of macOS Monterey, and both are available today on the Mac App Store.
“The world’s most creative people use Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, and the Mac to make the memorable movies, TV shows, online videos, songs, and soundtracks that we all enjoy,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “With the combination of powerful new features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, and the unprecedented performance from the MacBook Pro powered by the all-new M1 Pro and M1 Max, pros will be able to push the limits of their creativity like never before.”
Final Cut Pro 10.6
Final Cut Pro comes with innovative new features that allow editors to create beautifully tracked motion graphics and edit Cinematic mode videos recorded on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro. The app also takes full advantage of the major performance gains enabled by M1 Pro and M1 Max in the all-new MacBook Pro. Video editors can now play seven streams of 8K ProRes at full resolution — over 230 million pixels — and export ProRes video over 5x faster than before. Today’s update also introduces a new Object Tracker that lets video editors quickly and easily create eye-catching animated graphics that follow the movement of faces or objects in a video. Object tracking analysis is up to 5x faster on the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, and takes advantage of the machine learning capabilities of the Neural Engine in Apple silicon to accelerate the detection of faces and objects in video.
Videos recorded in Cinematic mode on the new iPhone 13 lineup can be edited easily with Final Cut Pro and Motion, giving editors the ability to adjust the depth effect of any shot and use keyframes to change it over time. By simply clicking on a face or object in the viewer, editors can add or delete focus points, all without having to reshoot.
Final Cut Pro companion apps Motion and Compressor also received updates today. With Motion on the new MacBook Pro, a complex project renders up to 2x as fast and can play two streams of 8K video at 5x the frame rate. Graphic artists can now combine object tracking with masks, shapes, 3D objects, behaviors, and filters for stunning visual effects. And a new Neon filter adds an eye-catching glow to images, shapes, text, and more.
On the new MacBook Pro, Compressor can transcode HEVC video up to 2x as fast and transcode ProRes video up to 10x faster. Compressor can also transcode Canon Cinema RAW Light video files to other professional formats like ProRes and H.264 for the first time, and Watch Folders make it simple to automatically encode content placed in a selected folder in the file system.
Logic Pro 10.7
Spatial audio represents the next generation of sound with its revolutionary audio experience and true multi-dimensional sound and clarity. Now with a complete set of mixing and rendering tools, Logic Pro allows anyone to author their songs as Dolby Atmos music files compatible with Apple Music. Musicians, producers, and mix engineers can expand their stereo projects to the surround channels supported by Dolby Atmos, using new mixer and panner controls. In addition, 13 plug-ins within Logic Pro — including Space Designer, Limiter, Loudness Meter, and Tremolo — have also been updated to take advantage of this new creative capability. Once the songs are published to Apple Music, listeners will be able to enjoy the immersive audio experience on their devices with spatial audio support. With the new MacBook Pro, musicians get workstation-class performance for creating massive spatial audio mixes, can quickly load large sample libraries, and can use up to 3x more plug-ins for recording.
Logic Pro now comes with all the new Producer Packs1introduced inGarageBandthis summer. Musicians can use beats, loops, and samples created by today’s biggest hitmakers, including Boys Noize, Mark Lettieri, Mark Ronson, Oak Felder, Soulection, Take A Daytrip, Tom Misch, and TRAKGIRL. Logic users now have access to 2,800 new loops, 50 new kits, and 120 new patches they can use in their own songs — all royalty-free. The update also features the original multitrack project of the hit song “Montero (Call Me by Your Name)” by Lil Nas X — including a Dolby Atmos spatial audio mix of the track.

PRESS RELEASE
Introducing the next generation of AirPods: The world’s most popular wireless headphones just got better
The new AirPods feature spatial audio and industry-leading sound, longer battery life, and an all-new design
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the third generation of AirPods featuring spatial audio, delivering advanced features and a magical experience in a new contoured design. By combining the power of the H1 chip with an Apple-designed acoustic system, the newAirPodsuse computational audio to deliver breakthrough sound with Adaptive EQ. Users can enjoy spatial audio featuring Dolby Atmos in Apple Music, movies, and tv shows, along with dynamic head tracking, across Apple devices. The new AirPods are resistant to sweat and water, and feature a force sensor for easy and intuitive control of music and phone calls. The extended battery life enables up to six hours of listening time1and up to 30 hours of total listening time with the convenient charging case. AirPods (3rd generation) join the world’s most popular family of headphones and are available to order starting today, and in stores beginning Tuesday, October 26.
“AirPods forever changed wireless headphones with their groundbreaking design, incredible sound, and magical experience,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “We are excited to introduce the next generation of AirPods, featuring unrivaled sound through Adaptive EQ and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, along with seamless interaction between Apple devices — making the world’s best-selling headphones even better.”
All-New Design
The new design of AirPods is lightweight and contoured, sitting at just the right angle for comfort and to direct audio into the ear. For a more subtle appearance, the stem is shorter than the previous generation and features the same intuitive force sensor as AirPods Pro for media control. The new AirPods are resistant to both sweat and water, with an IPX4 rating for both the earbuds and the charging case.2
Breakthrough Audio Features
AirPods (3rd generation) build on the great sound quality that AirPods are known for, starting with a custom driver and a high dynamic range amplifier that together produce powerful bass with crisp, clean high frequencies. The microphone is covered by an acoustic mesh to help reduce the sound of wind, so the speaker’s voice comes across distinctly on calls. AirPods also feature AAC-ELD, a superior speech codec that offers full HD voice quality, providing clear, natural communication for FaceTime calls.
The new AirPods use computational audio to bring the breakthrough experiences that customers love on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max — like Adaptive EQ and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking — to even more people.
For an optimal listening experience with rich detail, the new AirPods feature Adaptive EQ that tunes sound in real time based on how AirPods fit in the user’s ear. An inward-facing microphone monitors for sound, and then Adaptive EQ, powered by computational audio, tunes the low and mid frequencies to account for what may be lost due to variances in fit.
Spatial audio creates a three-dimensional theater-like experience, placing sound virtually anywhere in space, and with Dolby Atmos, AirPods have never sounded better. Users can also enjoy this multi-level experience with dynamic head tracking, so music, video, and even Group FaceTime calls feel more immersive than ever before. Using advanced spatial audio algorithms, and by applying directional audio filters to subtly adjust the frequencies that each ear receives, the new AirPods can place sound all around the user.
Magical Experience
With one-touch setup that automatically pairs AirPods with other Apple devices, users can effortlessly enjoy music throughout the day. Audio Sharing allows listeners to share the audio stream between two sets of AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max, while using iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV.
A new skin-detect sensor accurately discerns if AirPods are in the ear — versus in a pocket or on a table — and pauses playback when removed. To help with sound clarity, beamforming microphones block out ambient noise and focus on the user’s voice, while users can also enjoy a hands-free experience by simply saying “Hey Siri” for requests.
Longer Battery Life
AirPods (3rd generation) offer an extra hour of battery life over the previous generations, with up to six hours of listening time and up to four hours of talk time. Just five minutes of charging provides about an hour of battery life, and with four additional charges in the case, users can get up to 30 hours of total listening time.3AirPods are now also part of the MagSafe ecosystem for convenient wireless charging.
AirPods with iOS and iPadOS
AirPods offer exceptional convenience and sound quality, and with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, users can enjoy the following features:
Apple and the Environment
AirPods are designed with numerous materials and features to reduce their environmental impact, including the 100 percent recycled rare earth elements used in all magnets. The case also uses 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board, and 100 percent recycled aluminum in the hinge. AirPods are also free of potentially harmful substances such as mercury, BFRs, PVC, and beryllium. For energy efficiency, AirPods meet US Department of Energy requirements for battery charger systems. Apple’s Zero Waste program helps suppliers eliminate waste sent to landfills, and all final assembly supplier sites are transitioning to 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production. In the packaging, 100 percent of the virgin wood fiber comes from responsibly managed forests.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.

2021-10-18,Increase,Apple introduces HomePod mini in new bold and expressive colors,"Text of this article
October 18, 2021
PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces HomePod mini in new bold and expressive colors
HomePod mini delivers impressive sound, works seamlessly with iPhone, features the intelligence of Siri, and is the foundation for any smart home
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducedHomePod miniin three bold new colors — yellow, orange, and blue — giving users more ways to express their personality and style in any space. At just 3.3 inches tall, HomePod mini offers a great music-listening experience, the intelligence of Siri, and smart home capabilities, with privacy and security built in. Its seamless integration across Apple’s products and services make HomePod mini the ultimate smart speaker for anyone with an Apple device. HomePod mini will be available in these new colors, along with white and space gray, with color-matched details throughout, including the tinted touch surface, mesh fabric, volume icons, and woven power cable, starting in November for just $99.
“HomePod mini sounds incredible, and with access to more than 90 million songs in the global Apple Music catalog and deep integration with your Apple devices, it’s the must-have smart speaker for iPhone users,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “With new vibrant colors, HomePod mini fits in even more places and delivers amazing sound, the power of Siri, and simple and secure smart home controls, all while protecting your privacy.”
Big Sound in a Compact Speaker
HomePod mini uses computational audio to provide a rich and detailed acoustic experience and deliver peak performance. To achieve big sound out of such a compact design, the Apple S5 chip runs advanced software to analyze the unique characteristics of the music. It also applies complex tuning models to optimize loudness, adjust the dynamic range, and control the movement of the driver and passive radiators, all in real time. HomePod mini’s full-range driver, premium neodymium magnet, and pair of force-cancelling passive radiators enable it to produce deep bass and crisp high frequencies.
An Apple-designed acoustic waveguide directs the flow of sound down and out the bottom of the speaker for an immersive 360-degree audio experience. This design not only preserves richness and clarity, but makes it easy to place HomePod mini anywhere in a room and enjoy amazing sound from every angle. When placed in multiple rooms, HomePod mini speakers allow users to play the same music throughout the house, all in perfect sync, or a different song in every room. Placing two HomePod mini speakers in the same room creates a stereo pair for an even more immersive experience when listening to music. A three-microphone array listens for “Hey Siri,” and a fourth inward-facing microphone helps cancel out sound coming from the speaker to improve Siri’s ability to hear voice requests when music is playing.
Apple Music Voice on HomePod mini
HomePod mini is designed to work with Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, thousands of radio stations including the award-winning Apple Music 1 station, and popular music services like Pandora, Deezer, and others, providing entertainment for everyone.1Apple Music offers more than 90 million songs, all curated by world-class experts and tastemakers; thousands of curated playlists, including hundreds created specifically for the Apple Music Voice Plan; and more than 25,000 exclusive radio episodes and other original content. With the introduction of this new subscription tier, even more people will have access to this incredible catalog, hands-free, just by asking Siri.2
Ultimate Smart Speaker for iPhone Users
When listening to music or podcasts, or taking a phone call, users can seamlessly hand off the audio without missing a beat by bringing their iPhone close to HomePod mini. The experience gets more magical with any U1-equipped iPhone — with visual, audible, and haptic effects that make it feel like the devices are physically connected as sound flows from one to another. If nothing is playing on HomePod mini, personalized listening suggestions will automatically appear on iPhone when it is near the speaker, and instant controls are available without needing to unlock iPhone.3
Powerful Intelligent Assistant
With the intelligence of Siri, HomePod mini delivers a personalized and deeply integrated experience for iPhone customers. Siri can recognize the voices of up to six different household members, tailor music and podcasts to their preferences, and respond to personal requests, like reading their messages, reminders, notes, and calendar appointments, or making and answering phone calls.4Siri also provides users a personal update for a quick snapshot of their day. Users can ask “Hey Siri, what’s my update?” to hear the latest news, weather, traffic, reminders, and calendar appointments with a single request.
Effortless Smart Home Control
HomePod mini makes controlling smart home accessories effortless with simple voice commands for Siri to turn off the lights, change the temperature, lock the doors, set a scene, or control devices at specific times. Users can also get hands-free help by talking directly to various smart home accessories enabled with Siri. By design, Siri-enabled accessories will relay requests through a user’s HomePod mini on the same network, providing the level of privacy customers expect from Apple.
Intercom gives people a quick and easy way to connect at home. Users can send an Intercom message from one HomePod mini to another — whether in a different room, a specific zone, or multiple rooms throughout the home — and their voice message will automatically play on the designated HomePod mini. Intercom even works with iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and CarPlay, so everyone in the household can get Intercom notifications and send Intercom messages from the backyard, on their way home, or while out and about.
Designed with Privacy and Security in Mind
Privacy and security are fundamental to the design of Apple hardware, software, and services. With HomePod mini, only after “Hey Siri” is recognized locally on the device, or the user activates Siri by touch, will any information be sent to Apple servers. Requests are not associated with the user’s Apple ID, nor is personal information used for Apple’s advertising purposes or sold to other organizations. HomePod mini works with iPhone to complete requests for messages and notes on the device without revealing that information to Apple.
Additional Features
HomePod mini and the Environment
HomePod mini was designed with the environment in mind and supports Apple’s plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles, by 2030. HomePod mini utilizes 99 percent recycled rare earth elements, with the neodymium magnet in the speaker driver utilizing 100 percent recycled rare earth elements. The seamless mesh fabric is made with more than 90 percent recycled plastic, and all of the packaging wood fibers are from responsibly managed forests or recycled sources. HomePod mini is also free of mercury, BFRs, PVC, and beryllium.
HomePod mini uses power-efficient components and software that can intelligently power them down during periods of inactivity. For example, through optimized power management features and a high-efficiency power supply, HomePod mini has been designed to be efficient in its Low Power Mode, where the majority of time is spent. HomePod mini consumes 75 percent less energy than the stringent requirements for ENERGY STAR.

ISTANBUL, TürkiyeApple today announced Apple Bağdat Caddesi will open on Friday, October 22. Located in the heart of Istanbul, Apple Bağdat Caddesi will serve as Apple’s third retail location in Türkiye. This two-level destination blends local materials with the latest store design to create an open and fluid space for customers to explore Apple’s products and services, or participate in free Today at Apple sessions.
“With the opening of Apple Bağdat Caddesi, we’re thrilled to build upon the deep and long-standing relationships we have with our customers in Türkiye,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “We can’t wait to welcome the local community to our newest store in Istanbul and bring them the best of Apple.”
To celebrate the opening, Apple will debutPerspektif Istanbul, a six-week Today at Apple program that pays homage to the city and its creatives. Hosted by 20 local artists, the series brings creativity, culture, and technology together into an experience that examines topics and values important to the local community in Istanbul. Attendees will get a chance to join in-person and virtual sessions that include learning about traditional miniature drawing with illustrator Murat Palta, photographing the unseen with Magnum Photos photographer Sabiha Çimen, or creating a moving portrait with visual artist Sinan Tuncay.
The store will also host an exclusive augmented reality (AR) exhibition developed by creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting, and Turkish sound artist Oğuz Öner. The experience transforms the store with an immersive digital installation and includes many other artists participating in Perspektif Istanbul. Using the latest iPad Pro and iPhone 13 Pro with LiDAR, visitors will be able to see ceramic vessels inspired by Ebru — the traditional art of paper marbling — in AR on their screens, and hear unique spatial sound elements.
Apple Bağdat Caddesi brings forward familiar design elements from Apple Store locations around the world and Apple Park in Cupertino, California, while integrating locally sourced Aksaray Yaylak granite and Turkish travertine. Housed under a floating carbon fiber roof, the retail location creates an urban oasis in the heart of the city, complete with a large, tree-filled garden.
Once inside, visitors will find the video wall and Forum, home to Today at Apple sessions. The upper level is flanked by avenues, where customers can explore Apple’s latest products and services. The entire space overlooks the exterior of the store through a 32-foot glass curtain, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside. The interior is bathed in natural light through two large skylights that open to allow ventilation.
For 30 years, Apple has been a part of the Turkish community, and Apple Bağdat Caddesi’s team members look forward to deepening Apple’s relationship with local customers throughout Türkiye. The diverse, 130-person team at Apple Bağdat Caddesi collectively speaks 14 languages and will welcome its first visitors on Friday, October 22, at 10 a.m. local time. Because the health and well-being of customers and team members is Apple’s top priority, the store will implement comprehensive health measures.
Additionally, visits to Apple Bağdat Caddesi on opening day will be by appointment only. Customers can choose from available times atapple.com/tr/retail/bagdatcaddesi. Capacity will be limited, so guests may experience wait times before entering the store.

UPDATE
Apple introduces Tech Talks 2021, live online sessions for developers
Series of 100+ sessions and one-on-one conversations will support developers building best-in-class apps and games
Apple today kicked off Tech Talks 2021, a new online developer engagement series with more than 100 live sessions and 1,500 office hours running over the course of the next eight weeks.
Tech Talks will provide an opportunity for developers to directly connect with Apple experts to learn more about new technologies, ask questions, and receive one-on-one guidance. They will also serve as a new way for developers to share direct feedback with Apple team members about their experiences building and distributing apps on the App Store.
“Every single day, developers around the world are creating incredible apps and games for our platforms, and it’s our goal to provide them with every resource we can to help make the hard work they put in that much easier and more impactful,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “Our team is looking forward to connecting with even more developers around the world so we can better support the important work of this incredibly valued community, and listen to and learn from them.”
Sessions will be conducted online from Apple locations around the world in multiple time zones, including Bengaluru, India; Cupertino, California; London; Mexico City; São Paulo; Seoul, South Korea; Shanghai; Singapore; Sydney; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Tokyo. Each session includes a live presentation from Apple experts followed by a Q&A. Developers can get in-depth technical details on integrating SwiftUI, App Clips, HealthKit, machine learning, augmented reality, accessibility features, and more. They can also explore a variety of other development topics, including adopting 5G, publishing in-app events on the App Store, getting the most out of the App Review process, and getting started with enterprise development.
Office hours provide an opportunity for developers to meet with Apple experts across App Review, Evangelism, App Store Connect, and Developer Technical Support for one-on-one, 30-minute conversations about their apps. Developers can choose a topic and ask questions about technology usage and adoption, refining their designs, resolving issues, and understanding guidelines and tools. Office hours also give them an opportunity to share feedback.
Tech Talks 2021 sessions are free of charge, and open to current members of the Apple Developer Program and the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Registration opens today, with new sessions and office hour appointments posted every two weeks. For information on the schedule and registration, visitdeveloper.apple.com/tech-talks.

The App Store, which launched in 2008, is the world’s safest and most vibrant app marketplace, currently home to 1.8 million apps and visited by more than half a billion people each week across 175 countries. It helps creators, dreamers, and learners of all ages and backgrounds connect with the tools and information they need to build a brighter future and a better world.

2021-10-25,Decrease,macOS Monterey is now available,"Text of this article
October 25, 2021
UPDATE
macOS Monterey is now available
macOS Monterey delivers groundbreaking new features that help users connect in new ways, accomplish more, and work seamlessly across their Apple devices. FaceTime includes new audio and video features that make calls feel more natural and lifelike, and new Continuity tools like AirPlay to Mac enable Apple devices to work even better together. Live Text and Visual Lookup bring new intelligence features to surface useful information, Safari includes powerful tab organization with Tab Groups, and the ease of automation comes to the Mac with Shortcuts. Coming later this fall, SharePlay will enable Mac users to have shared experiences together through FaceTime, and Universal Control will make it easy for users to work effortlessly across their Mac and iPad. macOS Monterey is available today as a free software update on Macs with Apple silicon and Intel-based Macs.1
New Ways to Stay Connected with FaceTime
FaceTime calls sound more natural and lifelike, and SharePlay offers a new way for users to connect and enjoy time with friends and family. With spatial audio, voices in a FaceTime call sound like they are coming from where the person is positioned on the screen. Two new microphone modes give users more control over how their voice sounds: Voice Isolation eliminates background noise to ensure the user’s voice is crystal clear, and Wide Spectrum allows all the noise to come in so participants can hear everything. Portrait mode, a new feature in FaceTime and available in apps including Webex and Zoom, utilizes the Neural Engine in the M1 chip to keep the user in focus while blurring the background,2and a new grid view shows participants of a Group FaceTime call in same-size tiles.
SharePlay is a powerful set of features that will enable users to have shared experiences on a FaceTime call. Users can experience their favorite music, TV shows, movies, and more with friends and family in real time, and shared playback controls let anyone in a SharePlay session play, pause, or jump ahead. They can also share their whole screen or just a specific app, making it easy to collaborate with friends or coworkers on a call. SharePlay will work with apps like Apple Music and Apple TV+, as well as popular third-party services.
Working Across Apple Devices with Universal Control and AirPlay to Mac
With Universal Control, users will be able to work with a single mouse and keyboard and move seamlessly between Mac and iPad. Users can place devices next to each other and instantly move the cursor from one device to the other — no setup required. They can use their Mac keyboard to type text on any device, or drag and drop content back and forth easily between devices. Users can even draw with Apple Pencil on iPad, and place their illustrations right into apps on their Mac, enjoying the powerful capabilities of all their devices at once. With AirPlay to Mac, it’s easy to play, present, and share just about anything from iPhone or iPad right to a Mac. Use AirPlay to share the latest movies and games, photos, and presentations directly to the Mac’s stunning Retina display or to play music from across the room to the high-fidelity sound system in your Mac.
Live Text and Visual Lookup
Live Text detects text in photos, including phone numbers, websites, addresses, and more, so users can copy and paste, make a phone call, open a website, and easily look up more information. Visual Look Up helps users discover and learn about animals, art, landmarks, plants, and more in photos. Both Live Text and Visual Look Up work across macOS and leverage powerful on-device machine learning, so user data is kept private.
Focus Helps Users Stay on Task and Reduce Distractions
Focus filters notifications from apps and people based on what the user wants to focus on in that moment. When a user has Focus set on their Mac, it automatically sets across their other Apple devices. While using Focus, a status is automatically displayed in Messages and supported communication apps, like Slack, so others know not to interrupt when users are wrapping up a project or on vacation.
More Ways to Organize and Collaborate with Notes
With Notes in Monterey, users have new ways to collaborate, stay organized, and create notes from anywhere. Quick Note gives users the ability to jot down notes while in any app, so it’s easy to capture thoughts and ideas at any moment. Users can also add links from apps to a Quick Note, great for when they need to remember a website in Safari or quickly finding a location in Maps. New collaboration tools let users add mentions, as well as view updates to a shared note with the new Activity view. In Monterey, it’s easy to organize with Tags — a faster way to categorize notes and make them easy to find with the new Tag Browser.
Improved TabExperience in Safari
Safari offers users more control over how they browse the web, including a new Tab Groups feature that allows users to easily save and organize tabs — great for planning trips, researching projects, and storing the tabs users visit regularly. Tab Groups sync across Mac, iPhone, and iPad, so users can continue their project from anywhere, and easily share tabs with friends and family. Safari comes with new ways to experience the web, including a new optional compact tab bar design that gives users more space to browse, integration with Shared with You so users can easily access links sent from Messages, and support for Quick Note makes it easy to keep track of information discovered on websites. Safari also offers users more privacy protections, with Intelligent Tracking Prevention now preventing trackers from profiling users with their IP address.
Shortcuts Offers Seamless Automation on Mac
Shortcuts on the Mac helps users achieve peak productivity with the apps they use the most. With a rich gallery of pre-built shortcuts, it’s easy for users to automate everyday tasks, like instantly opening their frequently used apps to jumpstart their workday, or adding a reminder to their groceries list for when they get to the market, right from their Mac. And Shortcuts editor enables users to customize shortcuts to match their workflows. With Shortcuts integrated throughout macOS, including the menu bar, Finder, Spotlight, and Siri, it’s easy to run shortcuts at any time. Users can also import existing Automator workflows into Shortcuts and instantly be up and running.
Additional Features

macOS Monterey is available today as a free software update. For more information, including compatible Mac models, visitapple.com/macos/monterey.

October 27, 2021
PRESS RELEASE
Apple charges forward to 2030 carbon neutral goal, adding 9 gigawatts of clean power and doubling supplier commitments
Ahead of COP26, Apple launches 10 new initiatives to support communities around the world
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced it has more than doubled the number of suppliers committed to using 100 percent clean energy over the last year, accelerating progress toward its ambitious 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across its supply chain and products. In total, 175 Apple suppliers will transition to using renewable energy, and the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world. These actions will avoid over 18 million metric tons of CO2e annually — the equivalent of taking over 4 million cars off the road each year.
The company added 10 new projects for its first-of-a-kind Power for Impact initiative to bring clean energy solutions to communities around the world. These projects are designed to provide renewable power to under-resourced communities while supporting economic growth and social impact.
“Every company should be a part of the fight against climate change, and together with our suppliers and local communities, we’re demonstrating all of the opportunity and equity green innovation can bring,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re acting with urgency, and we’re acting together. But time is not a renewable resource, and we must act quickly to invest in a greener and more equitable future.”
While Apple is already carbon neutral across its global operations, by 2030, every Apple device sold will have a net-zero climate impact. Since announcing this goal last year, the company has not only dramatically increased the number of its suppliers transitioning to renewable energy, but also expanded the amount of recycled material in its products and established new projects focused on environmental justice. In total, Apple has reduced its carbon emissions by 40 percent over the past five years.
“For too long, the communities most impacted by climate change haven’t had a seat at the table. That has to change, and we’re committed to being part of that change,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “The new projects we’re sharing will help communities by developing new local renewable projects, creating a healthier and more equitable world while advancing the fight against climate change.”
Supplier Momentum
In the US, 19 suppliers in Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, including Solvay, are scaling their use of renewable energy across their Apple operations, often going beyond their business with Apple. In Europe, 19 suppliers are now part of the program, including STMicroelectronics, which has started nine additional projects to deliver renewable energy for its broader operations since joining Apple’s program.
In China, 50 suppliers are now part of the program, with many maximizing their use of on-site solutions. In India, Japan, and South Korea, 31 suppliers have joined, including SK Hynix, one of the first Korean suppliers to participate.
Apple is also creating new pathways for the use of recycled materials while maintaining its high standards for sourcing, collaborating with suppliers to move toward a circular economy that eliminates the need for carbon-intensive mining and conserves resources. This includes recycled sources of gold, cobalt, aluminum, and rare earth elements, among other materials that are now part of Apple products. These advancements, along with suppliers transitioning to renewable energy, are reducing the environmental impact of the company’s products. Recent milestones include an 11 percent reduction in the carbon footprint of iPhone 13 Pro and an eight percent reduction for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, compared to previous generations.
Supporting Communities
Apple is also announcing support for 10 new renewable projects around the world through its Power for Impact program:
In the United States, Apple will work with the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority, formed by six Sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources by financing, developing, constructing, and operating power generation and transmission facilities for the wholesale market. This project is on track to create a large-scale wind power development in the Midwest, and follows the organization’s participation in Apple’s Impact Accelerator, part of the company’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.
In South Africa, Apple is bringing renewable energy to over 3,500 households that previously lacked access. The company will also help reduce electricity costs for the Pioneer School for the Visually Impaired by funding rooftop solar installations. And in Nigeria, Apple will support the development of a solar power system to serve a primary healthcare center in the state of Ondo, as well as 200 households in the surrounding region.
In the Philippines, Apple will help fund an educational institution that provides scholarships to high-achieving, under-resourced students by offsetting electricity expenses through a new rooftop solar installation. In Thailand, Apple is participating in an effort to increase renewable energy production and battery storage to ensure reliable access to electricity, and replacing the use of polluting diesel fuel for a remote fishing village that relies on refrigerators to maintain the quality of its fish products. Apple’s work to support a program in Vietnam will provide solar electricity for 20 schools around the country, and help teach thousands of children about sustainable development and STEM.
In Colombia, Apple is helping to bring online a rooftop solar power system at the Santa Ana Hospital Infantil, and the money saved on energy bills will allow the hospital to purchase more equipment and medications. A rooftop solar installation at Ciudad Don Bosco, a nonprofit that provides educational and social services for under-resourced youth, will help the group advance its sustainable development goals.

Drawing from a lifetime of service, veterans use Apple technology to revolutionize trauma medicine
The iPad app T6 is helping healthcare providers harness the power of real-time information
The call comes in to the emergency line at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New York City: EMS are on the way with a 7-year-old boy who has been struck by a car. A 12-person Level I trauma team is activated to respond.
As the team assembles and prepares for the patient’s arrival, there’s a new tool in their kit. It’s a cutting-edge app called T6 that runs exclusively on iPad and leverages data to give medical professionals real-time feedback as they administer lifesaving trauma care.
Nathan Christopherson is vice president of surgery for Northwell Health, New York State’s largest healthcare provider, and he oversees all of its trauma centers, including Cohen Children’s Medical Center. He’s also a veteran, having served as a combat medic in the Army for more than a decade, and it’s that experience that led him to introduce T6 into Northwell’s emergency care — the first civilian healthcare provider in the US to do so.
“One of the most important parts of trauma care is how a patient moves through a medical system,” says Christopherson. “In the military, that’s going from managing the situation in the field, to transport, to arrival at a combat support hospital, and then onward — and one of the keys to optimizing that journey is the communication of data. We’ve taken those lessons and applied them to the civilian world, and T6 is a big part of helping us with that.”
Trauma surgeon Dr. Morad Hameed is one of T6’s co-founders, and he drew on the rich history of military trauma medicine to inform the app’s development.
T6 allows medical teams to input and analyze patient data in real time through iPad. In a hospital setting, data such as vitals and injury details are entered into the app and displayed on a large screen for the entire trauma team to see, along with standard-of-care guidelines and alerts. In the field, whether that’s in an ambulance or medical helicopter, or if T6 is being used by a military team or medic, the iPad app will allow real-time virtual communication between the person administering care and a trauma team in another location.
In addition to its adoption at Northwell Health, T6 has also been used by the US military at Craig Joint Theater Hospital at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio.
T6 gets its name from the concept of the “golden hour,” which is the period of time after a traumatic injury where medical intervention will help secure the best outcome. That time frame is commonly thought to be about six hours, based on lessons learned from the battlefield.
“When an unstable patient comes in with traumatic injuries and meets a big, multidisciplinary medical team assembled to treat them, the clock is already ticking,” says Hameed. “That point of intersection is a huge source of rich data if we could capture it. T6 was designed to do just that, in sufficient detail and relevance that we can actually improve our performance on the fly, and that’s never been done in healthcare.”
For example, T6 will trigger an alert to give a patient calcium at specific intervals during the course of a massive blood transfusion because that process depletes calcium, which is essential for healthy cardiac function. T6 alerts and guidelines are continually updated to reflect current best practices so that trauma and other acute care teams are always informed on the latest medical treatment protocols.
“We wanted to transform the existing treatment model and use data in a new and interactive way,” says Igor Muravyov, T6’s co-founder. “Every piece of information that is entered into T6 is immediately analyzed for clinical decision support. We engineered the app so that you can navigate to over 3,000 data input fields within two to three touches, and that kind of intuitive experience is only possible with iPad.”
Apple’s software development kits, including CloudKit, enable T6 to synchronize patient data and decision support across multiple devices.
“T6 runs on Apple exclusively for a lot of reasons: security, reliability, ease of use, power, and portability,” says Muravyov. “With Apple, we knew the quality of the hardware was going to be exceptional, and because T6 is being used in hospitals and in the military, security was paramount for us, and there’s no higher bar than the Apple ecosystem for data security.”
Col. Omar Bholat — a trauma surgeon with Northwell Health — has been in the Army reserves for the last 20 years, deploying on six combat tours. He’s started to receive training on T6 in advance of its launch at the hospital where he practices.
“Information is power, and T6 is a great tool to improve the accuracy of information transmission throughout the continuum of a patient’s care,” says Bholat. “In the military, we’ve learned how critical that is when it comes to moving severely injured patients from the field. T6 is going to help streamline the flow of data from the point of injury to the ICU and everywhere in between — that’s going to be huge for trauma medicine, whether that’s civilian or military.”
The T6 app is already in use at two of Northwell Health’s Level I trauma centers, with a full rollout scheduled by the end of 2022.
“We’re already seeing an increased adherence to trauma guidelines with our teams using the app,” says Christopherson. “The future is to continue leveraging this technology in different parts of patient care — not just Level I trauma centers, but Level IIs and IIIs as well — creating pathways for that data to go from point to point seamlessly. I can also see EMS using it at the scene of accidents to capture photos and videos to help inform care, and at rural hospitals for telemedicine — T6 has the power to do all of that.”
Back in the emergency department at Cohen Children’s Medical Center, all of the members of the trauma team have assembled. That’s when they learn that the patient they’re about to treat isn’t real — it’s part of a simulation event the hospital runs every month to sharpen and streamline their skills. But that doesn’t stop them from responding as if the medical dummy laying on the table in front of them is a boy who has been hit by a car. They enter his vitals and injuries into T6 and watch as the program responds with protocols and alerts. The simulation ends when the team decides the patient needs to be moved to the operating room.
Like so many of the tools Christopherson has brought to bear at Northwell Heath, the simulations trace their roots to his time in the Army.
“I think we can always do better, and in the military, that was the case too — we were always looking at how could we be more effective and save more lives,” says Christopherson. “The application of T6 is part of that. At the end of the day, the most important thing is helping people — that’s what drives me.”

November 10, 2021
PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces Apple Business Essentials
The new service, available today in beta, brings device management, support, and storage into one complete subscription for small businesses
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcedApple Business Essentials, an all-new service that brings together device management, 24/7 Apple Support, and iCloud storage into flexible subscription plans for small businesses with up to 500 employees. The company also unveiled a new Apple Business Essentials app that enables employees to install apps for work and request support.
Apple Business Essentials saves precious time for small businesses as they grow. Available today in beta, the service supports small businesses through the total device management life cycle — from device setup to employee onboarding and device upgrades — while providing strong security, prioritized support, and secure data storage and backup.
“Small businesses are at the core of our economy, and we’re proud that Apple products play a role in helping these companies grow,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Enterprise and Education Marketing. “Apple Business Essentials is designed to help streamline every step of employee device management within a small business — from setup, onboarding, and upgrading, to accessing fast service and prioritized support, all while keeping data backed up and secure, so companies can focus on running their business.”
Simple Setup and Onboarding with Collections
Apple Business Essentials is a complete solution that makes employee onboarding simple, allowing a small business to easily configure, deploy, and manage Apple products from anywhere.
Within Apple Business Essentials, Collections enable IT personnel to configure settings and apps for individual users, groups, or devices. When employees sign in to their corporate or personally owned device with their work credentials, Collections automatically push settings such as VPN configurations and Wi-Fi passwords. In addition, Collections will install the new Apple Business Essentials app on each employee’s home screen, where they can download corporate apps assigned to them, such as Cisco Webex or Microsoft Word.
Strong Security with FileVault, Activation Lock, and User Enrollment
With Apple Business Essentials, it’s simple to maintain strong security across the organization. IT managers can enforce critical security settings such as FileVault for full-disk encryption on Mac, and Activation Lock to protect devices that may be lost or stolen — and Apple Business Essentials ensures these aren’t turned off by mistake. When employees use a personal device at work, User Enrollment creates cryptographic separation for work data, to ensure employee data remains private while company data remains secure.
Secure Storage and Backup with iCloud
In addition to streamlined setup and onboarding, Apple Business Essentials provides a dedicated iCloud account for work, providing simple and secure storage, backup, and collaboration on files and documents. Business data in iCloud is automatically stored and backed up, making it easy to move between devices or upgrade to a new device.
Comprehensive Support and Repairs with AppleCare+ for Business Essentials
Businesses have the option to add fast and reliable service for employee devices with prioritized Apple Support. When a business adds AppleCare+ for Business Essentials to its plan, they get 24/7 access to phone support, training for both IT administrators and employees, and up to two device repairs per plan each year. Employees can initiate repairs directly from the new Apple Business Essentials app, and an Apple-trained technician can come onsite in as little as four hours to get their devices back up and running.
Flexible Subscription
A set of three simple Apple Business Essentials plans enable businesses to cover every employee and device in their organization. Plans can be customized to support each user with up to three devices and up to 2TB of secure storage in iCloud, starting at $2.99 per month, with optional AppleCare+ for Apple Business Essentials.1
Availability
Apple Business Essentials is available as a free beta starting today in the US. The service will be fully available in the spring of 2022. To sign up for the beta, visitapple.com/business/essentials.

The game is the first online social, action-adventure LEGO Star Wars2title. After crash-landing on a mysterious planet in the middle of a maelstrom, players will introduce themselves to brand new characters, and meet up with other players in a thriving social hub of activity as they play and compete in a variety of games. Fight Tusken Raiders, see Jabba’s palace on Tatooine, battle Stormtroopers on Endor, and navigate through the Death Star in simulations recorded at the Observatory. Players will join a team or go solo as they work to save these historical recordings amid growing corruption that’s altering celebrated moments inStar Warshistory. Between racing Microfighters, acquiring gear and customization options, and challenging their friends to battle in the Hippodrome, they’ll unravel the mystery together and experience simulations spanning the entire Star Warsgalaxy.

UPDATE
Today at Apple Creative Studios amplifies young artists’ voices from Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Chicago with community celebrations
Over the past year, emerging creatives across Los Angeles, Beijing, Bangkok, London, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., participated in and received career-building mentorships through Today at Apple Creative Studios. Participants gained hands-on experience, access to resources, and industry know-how, and used their learnings to create and present final projects to friends, family, and local communities.
This month, Creative Studios D.C., LA, and Chicago will reach these exciting milestones and celebrate the work of their participants:
“It has been so rewarding to see what these emerging young creatives can do with the tools and mentorship offered by our teams and incredible local partners,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “We can’t wait for their friends, family, and local communities to get together to experience their final projects, and celebrate what they’ve accomplished.”
Ahead of their celebrations, below are just a few of these young creatives’ stories:
Co-authors Joy Ugwu and Tseganesh Chala come from mixed cultures with Nigerian, Jamaican, Ethiopian, and American roots, and in “Joy-Grace and the Dress Dilemma,” they wanted to write a book about the challenges and beauty of having a multicultural identity. Their main character, Joy-Grace, is faced with choosing a garment to reflect her background for culture day at school, but her family is from Nigeria, Jamaica, and Ethiopia, so she struggles with how to represent them all.
“We want the book to relate to everyone, whether you are multicultural, from a different country, or even if you don’t come from a mixed background, something we all do relate to and struggle with in different ways is identity,” said Ugwu. “I hope this book brings comfort to young people who read it.”
When Hannah Abrahim joined Creative Studios - LA, she’d already been actively pursuing her dreams as a singer-songwriter, but wanted to enhance her skills. Abrahim’s work throughout the program resulted in her final project song, “Fantasy,” which started as a love letter to the city of LA, but soon became a love letter to its people. LA is full of individuals who share multicultural ethnic backgrounds like herself, and she wanted it to be empowering for them. The bridge sung in Spanish not only speaks to the large Latin population living in LA, but also Abrahim’s own Puerto Rican heritage.
Abrahim wants to continue to hone her craft as an artist singer-songwriter, and pursue that full time eventually. She’s currently working on polishing, producing, and recording her debut EP.
“I understand the weight music carries in society and how impactful it can be,” said Abrahim. “When people find an artist they really love, they hold on to every word, and I want to use my music to spread goodness and light.”
Jazmin Delgado studied photography at the University of Illinois Chicago, but had moved away from it upon graduating. “Creative Studios made me want to continue photography again,” she said. “My photography focuses on documentation of my city, my family, and as I continue to develop my craft, I feel like I am better understanding my own family’s history through these photographs.”
As a result, Delgado has been working on a brand of bags called Fiera — a Spanish word to describe a fierce woman — that incorporates hyper-masculine and hyper-feminine qualities seen through the traditional Mexican textiles she uses alongside elements like metal and steel.
Her final project features photography of her brand and echoes the dichotomy she feels between her Mexican and American cultures. Delgado’s imagery hopes to convey her identity through a new generation of women who are expressing themselves in a raw, “don’t mess with me” kind of way, with a uniquely Chicago feel.
About Today at Apple Creative Studios
Today at Apple Creative Studios builds on Apple’s history of providing free educational programming in Apple Store locations worldwide through Today at Apple. Apple, community partners, and mentors take participants through a curriculum of hands-on sessions, insider industry knowledge, and career mentorship to develop their creative skills, nurture participants’ self-expression, and encourage them to spark social change within their own communities.

November 17, 2021
PRESS RELEASE
Apple announces Self Service Repair
Apple parts, tools, and manuals — starting with iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 — available to individual consumers
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced Self Service Repair, which will allow customers who are comfortable with completing their own repairs access to Apple genuine parts and tools. Available first for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and soon to be followed by Mac computers featuring M1 chips, Self Service Repair will be available early next year in the US and expand to additional countries throughout 2022. Customers join more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs) and 2,800 Independent Repair Providers who have access to these parts, tools, and manuals.
The initial phase of the program will focus on the most commonly serviced modules, such as the iPhone display, battery, and camera. The ability for additional repairs will be available later next year.
“Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we’re providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.”
Apple builds durable products designed to endure the rigors of everyday use. When an Apple product requires repair, it can be serviced by trained technicians using Apple genuine parts at thousands of locations, including Apple (in-store or by mail), AASPs, Independent Repair Providers, and now product owners who are capable of performing repairs themselves.
Self Service Repair
To ensure a customer can safely perform a repair, it’s important they first review the Repair Manual. Then a customer will place an order for the Apple genuine parts and tools using the Apple Self Service Repair Online Store. Following the repair, customers who return their used part for recycling will receive credit toward their purchase.
The new store will offer more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers to complete the most common repairs on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13.
Self Service Repair is intended for individual technicians with the knowledge and experience to repair electronic devices. For the vast majority of customers, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get arepair.
Expanded Access to Apple Repairs
In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, including more than 2,800 Independent Repair Providers. The rapidly expanding Independent Repair Provider program originally launched in the US in 2019 and has since grown to more than 200 countries, enabling independent repair shops to access the same training, parts, and tools as other Apple Authorized Service Providers.
In addition, Apple continues to offer convenient repair options for customers through its global network of over 5,000 AASPs that help millions of people with both in- and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.
By designing products for durability, longevity, and increased repairability, customers enjoy a long-lasting product that holds its value for years. Apple also offers years of software updates to introduce new features and functionality.

UPDATE
SharePlay powers new ways to stay connected and share experiences in FaceTime
SharePlay is available with Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple TV+, NBA, Paramount+, SHOWTIME, TikTok, Twitch, and many more apps
SharePlay, a powerful set of features for shared experiences while on a FaceTime call, has introduced new ways for Apple users to stay connected. With SharePlay support in Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+ — as well as many of the most popular apps like NBA, TikTok, Twitch, Paramount+, and SHOWTIME — users can watch movies and TV shows, listen to music, or complete a workout with friends together on a FaceTime call. SharePlay extends to Apple TV so users can watch on the big screen while using FaceTime on iPhone or iPad. With screen sharing support, users can also browse the web together, look at photos, or show their friends something in a favorite app.SharePlayis available with the release of iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1, and is coming to Mac later this fall.
“SharePlay brings a whole new way to connect, share experiences, and have fun together on FaceTime,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “SharePlay leverages Apple’s integration of hardware and software to deliver a magical experience across iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, and works with many Apple services as well as some of the most popular apps in the App Store.”
New Ways to Stay Connected Through FaceTime
SharePlay makes it possible for iPhone, iPad, and Mac1users to share experiences with friends and family while on a FaceTime call. For example, users can chat with each other while having a viewing party, listening to an album with a friend, or completing a fitness challenge together from wherever they are, and SharePlay keeps all of these activities in sync across everyone on FaceTime.
SharePlay sessions offer shared playback controls, so anyone on the FaceTime call can play, pause, or jump ahead while enjoying synced media. With dynamic volume controls, audio from the streaming content will automatically lower when a FaceTime participant is speaking, making it easy to continue the conversation with friends despite a loud scene or climactic chorus. When users prefer to have uninterrupted sound, they can simply tap on the Messages button in the FaceTime controls to jump to a shared thread and keep the conversation going. Each participant in the SharePlay session streams directly from the relevant app on their own device, delivering high-fidelity audio and video. Apple TV supports SharePlay so users can watch shared shows or movies on the big screen while using their personal device to continue connecting with friends over FaceTime.
SharePlay is available with Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Fitness+, and some of the most popular apps in the App Store.
In addition to enjoying apps together, users can share their screens to browse the web, look at photos, or help each other out while on a FaceTime call.
Watch Together
Movies and TV shows can be streamed in sync while connecting over FaceTime with friends, offering a rich, real-time connection while watching the same content through apps like Apple TV, MUBI, Paramount+,and SHOWTIME. Users can even stream live content, like the latest game in the NBA app, or talk with friends over FaceTime while watching a favorite esports stream on Twitch. And soon, users will be able to watch together using apps like BET+, Disney+, ESPN, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Pantaya, Pluto TV, and Starz.
Listen Together
Users can bring songs, albums, and playlists right into their FaceTime call for a shared listening experience. With Apple Music, users can listen to a much-anticipated new album together or their favorite DJ mix completely in sync. Additional apps will be adding SharePlay support soon, including SoundCloud and TuneIn.
Practice Healthy Habits Together
SharePlay introduces brand new ways to inspire wellness with family and friends. For example, many people find it motivating when fitness is a shared experience, like taking a class together or having some friendly competition with a workout buddy. With the power of SharePlay, users can now work out or meditate together in Apple Fitness+,encourage one another through intervals with SmartGym, or wind down with a bedtime story together with BetterSleep.
Learn Together
With SharePlay, users can learn together despite physical distance. Kahoot! makes it possible to face off live in educational quizzes, Explain Everything allows users to chat over FaceTime while collaborating on a whiteboard, and Night Sky gives users a way to identify stars, planets, constellations, and satellites together.
Have Fun Together
Many developers have introduced entirely new ways to enjoy content in their app. For example, TikTok has added a way for users to watch a unique collection of videos together. Heads Up! fans can now play together even when they’re not in the same location. Cameo gives users a way to enjoy their friends’ reactions to a celebrity message when they see it for the first time. Popshop Live makes it possible to view shows and shop together. And with Apollo for Reddit, users in a SharePlay session can easily browse their favorite subreddits in sync.
Even more SharePlay experiences are available with apps like Bikemap, Flow by Moleskine Studio, Redfin, and more.
Screen Share Through SharePlay
With screen sharing through SharePlay, the possibilities are endless. Users can show off photos from a recent adventure, browse the web together while collaborating on a project, or teach a friend a skill while answering their questions right in the moment.

2021-11-23,Increase,Apple sues NSO Group to curb the abuse of state-sponsored spyware,"Text of this article
November 23, 2021
PRESS RELEASE
Apple sues NSO Group to curb the abuse of state-sponsored spyware
Apple also announced a $10 million contribution to support cybersurveillance researchers and advocates
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today filed a lawsuit against NSO Group and its parent company to hold it accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users. The complaint provides new information on how NSO Group infected victims’ devices with its Pegasus spyware. To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices.
NSO Group creates sophisticated, state-sponsored surveillance technology that allows its highly targeted spyware to surveil its victims. These attacks are only aimed at a very small number of users, and they impact people across multiple platforms, including iOS and Android. Researchers and journalists have publicly documented a history of this spyware being abused to target journalists, activists, dissidents, academics, and government officials.1
“State-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Apple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market — but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous. While these cybersecurity threats only impact a very small number of our customers, we take any attack on our users very seriously, and we’re constantly working to strengthen the security and privacy protections in iOS to keep all our users safe.”
NSO Group’s FORCEDENTRY Exploit
Apple’s legal complaint provides new information on NSO Group’s FORCEDENTRY, an exploit for a now-patched vulnerability previously used to break into a victim’s Apple device and install the latest version of NSO Group’s spyware product, Pegasus. The exploit was originally identified by the Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto.
The spyware was used to attack a small number of Apple users worldwide with dangerous malware and spyware. Apple’s lawsuit seeks to ban NSO Group from further harming individuals by using Apple’s products and services. The lawsuit also seeks redress for NSO Group’s flagrant violations of US federal and state law, arising out of its efforts to target and attack Apple and its users.
NSO Group and its clients devote the immense resources and capabilities of nation-states to conduct highly targeted cyberattacks, allowing them to access the microphone, camera, and other sensitive data on Apple and Android devices. To deliver FORCEDENTRY to Apple devices, attackers created Apple IDs to send malicious data to a victim’s device — allowing NSO Group or its clients to deliver and install Pegasus spyware without a victim’s knowledge. Though misused to deliver FORCEDENTRY, Apple servers were not hacked or compromised in the attacks.
Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market, and constantly invests in strengthening privacy and security protections for its users. For example, researchers have found that other mobile platforms have 15 times more malware infections than iPhone,2and a recent study showed that less than 2 percent of mobile malware targets iOS devices.3
iOS 15 includes a number of new security protections, including significant upgrades to the BlastDoor security mechanism. While NSO Group spyware continues to evolve, Apple has not observed any evidence of successful remote attacks against devices running iOS 15 and later versions. Apple urges all users to update their iPhone and always use the latest software.
“At Apple, we are always working to defend our users against even the most complex cyberattacks. The steps we’re taking today will send a clear message: In a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,” said Ivan Krstić, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture. “Our threat intelligence and engineering teams work around the clock to analyze new threats, rapidly patch vulnerabilities, and develop industry-leading new protections in our software and silicon. Apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like NSO Group.”
Apple’s Continuing Efforts to Protect Its Users
Apple commends groups like the Citizen Lab and Amnesty Tech for their groundbreaking work to identify cybersurveillance abuses and help protect victims. To further strengthen efforts like these, Apple will be contributing $10 million, as well as any damages from the lawsuit, to organizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy.
Apple will also support the accomplished researchers at the Citizen Lab with pro-bono technical, threat intelligence, and engineering assistance to aid their independent research mission, and where appropriate, will offer the same assistance to other organizations doing critical work in this space.
“Mercenary spyware firms like NSO Group have facilitated some of the world’s worst human rights abuses and acts of transnational repression, while enriching themselves and their investors,” said Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. “I applaud Apple for holding them accountable for their abuses, and hope in doing so Apple will help to bring justice to all who have been victimized by NSO Group’s reckless behavior.”
Apple is notifying the small number of users that it discovered may have been targeted by FORCEDENTRY. Any time Apple discovers activity consistent with a state-sponsored spyware attack, Apple will notify the affected users in accordance with industry best practices.
Apple believes privacy is a fundamental human right, and security is a constant focus for teams across the company. For years, Apple has led the industry with new protections to disrupt sophisticated attacks and defend its users, including features such as pointer authentication codes (PAC), BlastDoor, and the Page Protection Layer (PPL).

UPDATE
Apple Podcasts presents the Best of 2021
Apple celebrates this year’s best and most popular podcasts and their creators
Each year, Apple recognizes the best and most popular podcasts for their exceptional content, unique ability to engage audiences, and innovation in craft, spanning production, presentation, sound design, and more, that expand the definition of podcasting and deepen its impact on listeners worldwide. This year,Apple Podcasts Best of 2021features shows and creators that provided listeners with a powerful sense of connection in a challenging and uncertain time, curated by Apple Podcasts’ world-class editorial team.
Apple Podcasts is pleased to recognize “A Slight Change of Plans” with Maya Shankar from Pushkin Industries as Best Show of the Year, and “Anything for Selena” with Maria Garcia from WBUR and Futuro Studios as Newcomer of the Year. These deeply personal yet universally relatable shows grapple with profound change, perceptions of identity and self-worth, and the meaning of belonging, with thought-provoking discussions that reflect the human experience.
“2021 marked the start of a new chapter for podcasting with shows that moved us in ways unlike ever before,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “We are honored to recognize the phenomenal creators who are redefining podcasting with this year’s best shows, and to help more listeners around the world discover, enjoy, and support their inspiring work.”
Best Show of the Year: “A Slight Change of Plans” with Maya Shankar
Maya Shankar is no stranger to change. Before she was a cognitive scientist who founded the White House Behavioral Science Team and served as the first Behavioral Science Advisor to the United Nations, she had a different plan. “My whole childhood revolved around the violin, but that changed in a moment when I injured my hand playing a single note,” said Shankar, who was a student of Itzhak Perlman at The Juilliard School at the time. “I was forced to try and figure out who I was, and who I could be, without it.”
“A Slight Change of Plans” blends compassionate storytelling with the science of human behavior to help listeners navigate their own big change. “It’s easy for us to feel overwhelmed by any given change. I’ve often found myself thinking, ‘I’ve never gone through this particular change before — what do I do?’” Shankar said. “But while our changes may appear different on the surface, cognitive science teaches us that the strategies we use to navigate those changes can be quite similar. Which is heartening to realize! It means we can learn from changes that don’t look like ours.”
The show features stories about all sorts of change, from Tiffany Haddish discussing how she navigated the foster care system and discovered that she had a rare gift that would change her life, to John Elder Robison, who underwent experimental brain treatment to try and increase his emotional sensitivity. The show dives deep into the science of change with experts like Adam Grant and Angela Duckworth, and features illuminating conversations with Oscar-nominated actor Riz Ahmed, Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves, professional rock climber Tommy Caldwell, and other real-life inspirations like Shankar herself, who had her own slight change of plans earlier this year.
Newcomer of the Year: “Anything for Selena” with Maria Garcia
“Anything for Selena” asks profound questions about belonging. “I loved Selena since I was 7 years old,” said journalist Maria Garcia. “I couldn’t articulate this when I was younger, but I felt a profound sense that she mattered — not just because of her music, but because of her expansive cultural impact.”
That set Garcia on a personal quest, leading her to ask questions about Latino fatherhood, fraught relationships with race and language, and her own identity. “We tried to make meaning of Selena’s life and legacy,” she said. “I wanted to write her a love letter, an ode, a beautiful story.”
“We started production in the summer of 2020,” Garcia added. “I recorded the show with just my microphone and MacBook in my walk-in closet, which we padded for crisp sound, so the podcast truly came together in the thick of the pandemic. It felt natural to use the tools of my craft — rigorous reporting, vulnerable storytelling, cultural analysis — to do Selena’s legacy justice, to prove that she left an indelible mark on Latino identity and American belonging. And so many people wrote to tell me that the podcast made them feel seen.”
In addition to Best Show of the Year and Newcomer of the Year, Apple recognized a curated collection of shows and episodes that defined and reflected 2021.
Shows of the Year
“A Kids Book About: The Podcast” with Matthew Winner, for taking a thoughtful, friendly, and considered approach to explaining the big things in life — fear, failure, and divorce, for instance — but also activism, sharing, and money, to kids.
“Anything Goes with Emma Chamberlain,” for making listeners feel as though they’re her best friend, helping them through doubt and sadness with her unique frankness, keen observations, and genuine affection.
“Good Inside with Dr. Becky,” for Becky Kennedy’s calming, validating voice to parents everywhere, acknowledging that if this time (and parenting generally) feels hard, that’s because it is.
“Las Culturistas with Matt Rogers and Bowen Yang” from Will Ferrell’s Big Money Players Network, for a joyfully escapist experience that takes listeners on a quirky, hilarious, and unforgettable journey into the beating heart of culture.
“Pantsuit Politics” with Sarah Stewart Holland and Beth Silvers, for offering a unique approach to the news and politics through grace-filled conversations that unpack the valid, complicated, hard differences that persist in this moment.
“Teenager Therapy” with Gael Aitor, Kayla Suarez, Mark Hugo, and Thomas Pham, for reminding everyone that direct, vulnerable conversations among friends — no matter the issue — is the best medicine.
“The Experiment” from The Atlantic and WNYC Studios with Julia Longoria, for elucidating the notion that countries — like people — are unfinished works in progress, and facilitating a dialogue about what it means to be a citizen.
“The Midnight Miracle” from Luminary with Talib Kweli, yasiin bey, and Dave Chappelle, for a completely original experience that transports listeners into the room with remarkable energy from its hosts and very special guests.
“This Land” from Crooked Media with Rebecca Nagle, for investigating and explaining the experiences of Native Americans to recontextualize America’s understanding of its own history.
“U Up?” with Jordana Abraham and Jared Freid, for exploring the very real — often hilarious — concerns of trying to find a partner, with banter that keeps listeners coming back no matter their relationship status.
Episodes of the Year

“The Symphony,” a mesmerizing, lyrical trip featuring Kevin Hart, Questlove, Mo Amer, Bill Burr, Pras, Michelle Wolf, and Jon Stewart, from “The Midnight Miracle” with Talib Kweli, yasiin bey, and Dave Chappelle, by Luminary.
“The Unwritten Rules of Black TV,” which traces the cyclical, uneven history of Black representation on television, from “The Experiment” with Hannah Giorgis by The Atlantic and WNYC Studios.

Apple announces third annual Apple Music Award winners: The Weeknd wins global award for Artist of the Year; Olivia Rodrigo and H.E.R. also take home top awards
Apple gives five new Regional Artist of the Year awards to Aya Nakamura (France), OFFICIAL HIGE DANDISM (Japan), RIN (Germany), Scriptonite (Russia), and Wizkid (Africa)
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the winners of the third annual Apple Music Awards, recognizing the best artists of 2021 and their influence on global culture.
The Apple Music Awards honor achievements in music across five distinct categories — Artist of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Breakthrough Artist of the Year, Top Song of the Year, and Top Album of the Year — and winners are chosen through a process that reflects both Apple Music’s editorial perspective and what customers around the world are listening to the most.
This year, the Apple Music Awards will introduce a new category of awards for Regional Artist of the Year, recognizing artists from five countries and regions: Africa, France, Germany, Japan, and Russia. The Regional Artist of the Year awards recognize artists who made the greatest impact culturally and on the charts in their respective countries and regions.
“The past 12 months have proved to be a remarkable year for music, and we’re thrilled to honor the artists who are shaping culture and connecting with fans around the world on Apple Music,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “This year we’re also recognizing more regional artists, showing the world the impact of extraordinary talented musicians who are making waves globally.”
The Apple Music Awards celebration kicks off Tuesday, December 7, 2021, with interviews, original content, and more all streaming worldwide on Apple Music and the Apple TV app. Music fans who are not already subscribed to Apple Music can sign up for a three-month free trial atapple.com/apple-music.
And the winners are…
Global Artist of the Year: The Weeknd
Filtering R&B and pop through an ambitious widescreen lens, The Weeknd took over popular music and culture on his own terms. The global superstar’s 2020 album “After Hours” quickly surpassed one million pre-adds on Apple Music, and is the most pre-added album of all time by a male artist on the platform. “After Hours” also holds the record for the most streamed R&B/Soul album in its first week in 73 countries. The smash single “Blinding Lights” peaked at No. 1 on Apple Music’s Daily Top 100: Global chart, and ranks as one of the 20 most Shazamed songs of all time. The Weeknd also hosts the massively popular taste-making Apple Music Radio show “MEMENTO MORI,” celebrated for its eclectic playlists and major world premieres. He’s graced recent covers of TIME, Forbes, Variety, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Harper’s Bazaar, and GQ, and blew away fans with his 2021 Super Bowl LV Halftime Show, which was one of the most Shazamed moments of the year.
“I’m so grateful for this huge honor and want to thank Apple for all its support, not only for my work but also for great music by newer artists, where it matters so much for creators to be found and supported,” The Weeknd said.
Breakthrough Artist of the Year, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year: Olivia Rodrigo
For Olivia Rodrigo, 2021 will go down as the year of epic firsts. The 18-year-old singer-songwriter released her tear-soaked debut single, “drivers license,” in January, which quickly topped the charts and became one of the most streamed new releases of the year. “drivers license” registered the highest first-week streams ever for a debut single by an artist on Apple Music globally, reaching No. 1 on the Daily Top 100: Global chart, where it remained for over a month, and was the fastest-ever debut solo track by a US artist to accumulate five million Shazams. Her highly anticipated debut album, “SOUR,” followed in May, and was celebrated with an Apple Music First Listen virtual event with fans and an accompanying interview with Zane Lowe. “SOUR” carries the highest first-week streams for a debut album on Apple Music globally, with all 11 songs on the album ranked on the Daily Top 100: Global chart, as well as the Daily Top 100 chart in 66 additional countries. Rodrigo has been on the cover of Apple Music playlists Today’s Hits, A-List Pop, and New Music Daily, and closes her life-changing year as the deserving recipient of her first three Apple Music Awards. She took home Breakthrough Artist, Album of the Year (“SOUR”), and Song of the Year (“drivers license”).
“I did my first interview for ‘drivers license’ with Apple Music, and so much has happened since then,” Rodrigo said. “It’s truly surreal. Thank you to Apple Music for these amazing awards.”
Songwriter of the Year: H.E.R.
Award-winning singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist H.E.R.’s work within the R&B genre grew even more expansive in 2021 with the release of her acclaimed 21-track album “Back of My Mind,” which captures the artist at her most brilliant, confident, and freewheeling. The chart-topping album was the third most streamed R&B/Soul album on Apple Music in its first week of release by a female artist this year, with singles “Damage” and “Come Through” (featuring Chris Brown) both spending multiple weeks on the Daily Top 100 chart in over 30 countries. The former Apple Music Up Next artist also penned the anthemic original “Fight for You” for the celebrated motion picture “Judas and the Black Messiah,” and covered Marvin Gaye’s“Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)”for Apple Music’s exclusive“Juneteenth: Freedom Songs”compilation. H.E.R. is a regular guest on Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden’s shows on Apple Music 1, and she has been featured as the cover of popular Apple Music playlists New Music Daily, R&B Now, and more.
“I am very honored and blessed to receive this recognition,” H.E.R. said. “As a young Black and Filipino artist, and a woman who is on the stage giving my all, there’s no doubt that representation is important. Thank you so much, Apple Music.”
Artist of the Year (Africa):Wizkid
Singer-songwriter Wizkid is one of Africa’s biggest crossover acts, having worked with Drake, Skepta, and Chris Brown, among others. The Nigerian musician first found regional success in 2011 with the massively popular single “Holla at Your Boy,” which appeared on his debut album, “Superstar.” Wizkid went global in 2016 after his collaboration with Drake on “One Dance,” which soared to the top of the charts in 15 countries. Between 2019 and 2020, Wizkid was featured in Beyoncé’s projects “The Lion King: The Gift” and its companion piece, “Black Is King.” In October 2020, he released “Made in Lagos,” his critically acclaimed and most commercially successful album, which included his hit song “Essence,” a track that gained 125 million plays on Apple Music and over 2.8 million Shazams. This past year, he’s been the most streamed African artist on the continent on Apple Music and ranked on the Daily Top 100 charts in 60 countries, in addition to his monthly plays on Apple Music growing by more than 250 percent outside of Africa. He’s also been featured on Apple Music’s Today’s Hits and R&B Now playlists, and he’s a frequent guest on Apple Music Radio shows, including “Africa Now Radio,” “The Ebro Show,” “New Music Daily with Zane Lowe,” and “OVO SOUND RADIO.”
“Thank you to Apple Music for this award,” Wizkid said. “It’s a blessing to get to do what I do, and I’m proud to be representing for Africa.”
Artist of the Year (France): Aya Nakamura
French-Malian pop singer Aya Nakamura is the most streamed Francophone artist in the world. Best known for her hit song “Djadja,” she has released three albums featuring countless chart-topping songs, including “Copines,” “Pookie,” “Plus Jamais,” and “Jolie nana,” and she has been on the cover of Apple Music’s Hits Français playlist. In France, Nakamura is one of the only female artists to consistently appear in the streaming charts in a market dominated by male rappers, and her album “AYA” garnered the highest first-week streams for an album released by a female artist on Apple Music. Her songs “Jolie nana” and “Plus Jamais” hold the top two spots for the highest first-week streams for a song by a female artist on Apple Music in France, and all 15 songs on the album entered the Daily Top 100 chart in France, Belgium, and Niger, with “Jolie nana” peaking at No. 1 in those countries. Her song “Bobo” also peaked at No. 1 on the Daily Top 100 chart in France, Niger, Cape Verde, and Micronesia. It marked her fifth single topping France’s Daily Apple charts.
“I am extremely honored to be the very first Francophone artist to win an Apple Music Award as Artist of the Year (France),” Nakamura said. “Thank you, Apple!”
Artist of the Year (Germany): RIN
Rapper Renato Simunovic, aka RIN, was born in 1994 in Bietigheim-Bissingen near Stuttgart in the south of Germany. After releasing his first EP, “Genesis,” in 2016, his debut album, “Eros,” followed quickly in 2017. A 25-time gold and three-time platinum artist, RIN has performed countless live shows, done features with legends, and collaborated with some of the world’s most influential brands. With his third album, “Kleinstadt,” RIN freed himself from the idea of what German rap should sound like, and fans and critics alike cite this album as hugely influential in shaping the current sound of rap in the south of Germany. He was the first German artist to host his own show on Apple Music, “KLEINSTADTRADIO,” tied to the new album, and he has graced the cover of Apple Music’s HYPED and Deutschrap 100 playlists.
“2021 was such a good year for me because it has borne a lot of fruit of things that I postponed for a long time,” RIN said. “My music has evolved in the same sense. I am much more personal.”
Artist of the Year (Japan): OFFICIAL HIGE DANDISM
Formed in Shimane, Japan, in 2012, OFFICIAL HIGE DANDISM, aka HIGEDAN, consists of lead vocalist and keyboardist Satoshi Fujihara, guitarist Daisuke Ozasa, bassist and saxophonist Makoto Narazaki, and drummer Masaki Matsuura. They released their debut mini album, “Love to Peace wa Kimi no Naka,” in 2014. Their first full-length album, “Escaparade” — which includes their popular song “No Doubt” — was released in 2018, but it was their second single, “Pretender,” that rocketed to the top of the Apple Music charts in Japan. HIGEDAN entered Shazam’s emerging artists lists in Japan and Australia for the first time in June 2019, ahead of the release of the band’s follow-up album, “Traveler,” which became their first No. 1 album in Japan. The group has been featured in three different Apple Music Japan commercials, with their hit songs “Stand by You” and “I Love…,” along with the 2021 song “Apoptosis,” taken from their third album, “Editorial,” which carries the third-highest first-week streams for an album released in 2021 in Japan, and was recently featured in an Apple Music Japan spatial audio with Dolby Atmos commercial. The band has also made several guest appearances on “J-Pop Now Radio” on Apple Music 1.
“We didn’t know Japanese artists could win this award and were shocked when we were told,” the band said. “We’re super happy to be the winners of the first Apple Music Award for Artist of the Year (Japan).”
Artist of the Year (Russia): Scriptonite
Rapper Scriptonite, aka Adil Zhalelov, was discovered by Basta and signed to his label Gazgolder in 2015. Scriptonite’s debut album, “House with Normal Activity,” became an instant classic and has been deemed one of the biggest records of the new Russian hip-hop revolution. In 2017, Scriptonite followed up with two more LPs on Gazgolder, rising to the top-ranked producer and performer of the current hip-hop era, with fans and critics crediting him as the most important voice and sound of the new generation. After starting his own label, Musica36, in 2019, Scriptonite’s “2004” album was released exclusively on Apple Music to critical acclaim, becoming the No. 1 streamed record of the year. Scriptonite also holds the record for the two most streamed albums for its first week on Apple Music in five countries (Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova). His single “Baby Mama” landed him in the Top 20 of worldwide Shazam charts. In 2020, Apple Music exclusively released the short film “Behind Scriptonite’s ‘2004’” along with a “36 Jam” live concert of all Musica36 artists. This year saw the release of his album “Svistki Y Bumazhki,” as well as a COVID-postponed show in Moscow, both released exclusively on Apple Music. Scriptonite has graced the covers of Apple Music’s Kirillitsa, Russian Hits, and New Music Daily playlists, and he’s currently working on his first English-language record in collaboration with Gee Baller, a young Nigerian rising star who recently signed to Musica36.
“This award is the culmination of an incredible few years, and Apple Music has been with me for so much of it along the way,” Scriptonite said. “Thank you for the recognition.”

December 1, 2021
UPDATE
15 years fighting AIDS with (RED): Apple helps raise nearly $270 million
On World AIDS Day, Apple offers new ways to support (RED)’s critical work to combat HIV/AIDS and COVID-19
Over the past 15 years, Apple customers have played a critical role in (RED)’s fight to end AIDS through support to the Global Fund, which provides critical access to healthcare services in communities most in need in sub-Saharan Africa. As COVID-19 continues to impact communities around the world, including those living with HIV, the fight to end global pandemics is more urgent than ever.
To honor World AIDS Day this year, Apple is offering new ways for customers to learn, engage, and donate — raising funds and awareness to support people on the front lines of both AIDS and COVID-19.
Since 2006, Apple customers have helped raise nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing, and counseling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS. Apple-supported grants have enabled care and support services for over 11 million people, provided over 192 million HIV tests, and allowed over 13.8 million people access to lifesaving antiretroviral treatments. In 2020 alone, Apple’s support for (RED) helped prevent over 145,000 HIV-positive mothers from passing the virus on to their babies.
With support from Apple, (RED) has been able to expand its scope to provide additional services and support to the vulnerable communities that are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Over the past 18 months, COVID-19 has created new challenges in accessing care, diagnostics, and supplies, often further stretching crucial HIV/AIDS programs. To meet these challenges, Apple was one of the first companies to shift attention and resources to the Global Fund’s COVID-19 Response.
By redirecting donations to the Global Fund’s COVID-19 Response at the onset of the pandemic, Apple customers were able to help fund programs that mitigated the impact of COVID-19 on existing HIV/AIDS programs. In Zambia, local clinics were able to purchase motorbikes that were used to deliver lifesaving HIV treatment to local communities when in-person visits declined due to COVID-19. This year, support from Apple and its customers helped fund programs in Ghana that gave medical providers the resources to procure bulk supplies so they could make multi-month deliveries to those most at risk, reducing their potential exposure to viral infection.
Support Efforts to End HIV, AIDS, and COVID-19
This year, Apple is offering more ways than ever for customers to support (RED) and its critical work through (PRODUCT)RED devices and accessories, an Apple Pay donation program, and special service collections.
Apple is offering a range of new (PRODUCT)RED devices and accessories this holiday season, including iPhone 13 (PRODUCT)RED, iPhone 13 mini (PRODUCT)RED, and Apple Watch Series 7 (PRODUCT)RED. A portion of the proceeds from every (PRODUCT)RED purchase goes directly to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Through the end of next year, half of the eligible proceeds from (PRODUCT)RED purchases will be redirected to the Global Fund’s COVID-19 Response to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 on the fight to end AIDS.
Now through December 6, Apple is donating $1 to the Global Fund for every purchase made with Apple Pay on apple.com, in the Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store.1Every donation will help fund (RED)’s fight against AIDS and COVID-19.
Starting today, Apple Watch users can show their support for (RED) directly from their wrist with a selection of six Apple Watch faces in red available for download fromapple.com/product-red.2Once downloaded, these faces can also be shared with other Apple Watch users with Face Sharing. The watch faces pair with the new Apple Watch Series 7 PRODUCT(RED) aluminum case, made from 100 percent recycled aerospace-grade alloy as well as PRODUCT(RED) Braided Solo Loop, Sport Band, and Sport Loop bands.
Spreading Awareness
To raise visibility for World AIDS Day and the ongoing effort to eradicate HIV/AIDS, hundreds of Apple Store locations are marking the week with red logos or window displays.
Across Apple’s services, the company is also offering a variety of ways for customers to learn more about the pandemic and honor those whose lives have been affected. The App Store is highlightingPositive Singles, an inclusive dating app that connects singles living with HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections. The app also provides tips and resources for those who have been recently diagnosed and are looking for helpful information.
In the US, Apple Books will feature collections of books and audiobooks, including nonfiction books about the global fight against HIV/AIDS and fiction books from around the world. Apple Podcasts will feature shows that examine the state of the global AIDS crisis, including episodes that investigate how racism has inhibited access to quality care, describe the latest in preventative medicine and how it’s been unevenly distributed, and explain why there still isn’t a cure. On Apple Music, subscribers can listen to a curated selection of music programming, radio episodes, and more in a specialApple Music featurein recognition of World AIDS Day. And Apple TV app users can explore a riveting collection of TV shows and movies on the Watch Now tab that reveal the human cost of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

2021-12-01,Decrease,"Community caregivers spread hope in Ghana amid two pandemics, with support from Apple","Had the groundwork not been laid for fighting HIV over the last two decades by the Global Fund and contributing partners like Apple, so much of what we’re doing today to address larger healthcare issues, including COVID-19, would not be possible.
Luisa Engel, (RED)’s Chief Impact Officer

Community caregivers spread hope in Ghana amid two pandemics, with support from Apple
At St. Martin de Porres Hospital on the outskirts of Accra in Ghana, Joseph is beginning a very important journey. The 27-year-old is picking up a two-months’ supply of lifesaving antiretroviral therapy medication (ART), but the drugs are not for him, even though he has taken them daily since he was diagnosed with HIV at age 11.
Joseph is part of a program called Model of Hope, which is run by the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG), and enlists the help of people living with HIV to assist others who have tested positive for the virus. CHAG is one of the many community-based organizations and healthcare providers in Ghana supported by the Global Fund.
This year, Apple is marking 15 years of partnership and nearly $270 million raised through its (PRODUCT)RED campaign to support the Global Fund’s efforts to stop the spread of AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa.
COVID-19 has made this mission even more critical. To address the dual challenges, last year the Global Fund launched its COVID-19 Response to help to alleviate the impact of this second pandemic on communities already grappling with HIV and AIDS. Apple was one of the first companies to shift attention and resources to the Global Fund’s COVID-19 efforts, and will continue redirecting half of eligible proceeds from (PRODUCT)RED purchases to the COVID-19 Response through the end of 2022, with the other half going directly to the fight to end AIDS.
Joseph is one of 13.8 million people who has access to ART as a result of Apple’s contributions to the Global Fund’s efforts in Africa, and he sees the effect COVID-19 is having on those he counsels through the Model of Hope program.
“When it’s time for them to come in to get their medication, sometimes they don’t because of COVID,” says Joseph. “Because they are afraid — they think, ‘When you come to the hospital, you get COVID,’ so many do not come at all.”
For immunocompromised individuals, like those with HIV who must take ART every day, missing those appointments puts them in grave danger — but so does exposure to COVID-19. Model of Hope volunteer workers like Joseph ensure that many patients receive medication and counseling, even when they are not willing or able to travel.
“When COVID struck, we had a lot of businesses shut down and we had a lot of movement restricted,” says Kafui Kornu, CHAG’s senior communications officer. “So the Model of Hope system helped in that regard, and they’ve been doing very well identifying [those in] need and delivering their drugs to them. When they go, they identify that it’s not just that a person doesn’t want to come, but there’s actually some other problem that needs to be solved to enable them to get access to the drug.”
Rebecca, 45, is also a volunteer worker in the Model of Hope program, and has been on ART for 15 years. Despite her HIV diagnosis, she has given birth to three children who all tested negative for the virus because she followed prevention of mother-to-child transmission protocols, or PMTCT. As a result of Apple’s contributions to the Global Fund over the last 15 years, more than 5 million pregnant women have been able to receive PMTCT counseling to help prevent passing on HIV to their children.
“Had the groundwork not been laid for fighting HIV over the last two decades by the Global Fund and contributing partners like Apple, so much of what we’re doing today to address larger healthcare issues, including COVID-19, would not be possible,” says Luisa Engel, (RED)’s Chief Impact Officer. “The healthcare worker that was trained to fight the spread of HIV is also going to be able to diagnose your child with malaria, to make sure your blood sugar looks right if you have diabetes, and put a COVID-19 vaccine in your arm. So there’s a much bigger health impact that comes from the community infrastructure built by the Global Fund and supported by companies like Apple.”
In Ghana, that translates to a 21 percent decrease in new HIV infections over the last decade, and 200,000 people on ART, up from 40,000 in 2010. A huge part of that success is rooted in the Global Fund’s work in communities, and with HIV-positive volunteer workers who help to combat the stigma that is associated with a positive diagnosis by showing that a full life is possible with treatment.
“I say, look at me — I started taking the drugs when I was young, and now I’m 27,” says Joseph. “One day I want to be a lab technician, to continue my education. So if you take your ART, you can be like me; I know one day I will be someone in the future.”
Rebecca talks about her status with those she counsels and her own children, to give them the tools they need to protect themselves and others. She sees her volunteer work as a way of giving back.
“I wanted to be a Model of Hope because somebody helped me,” says Rebecca. “I’m still alive now, I suppose, to help others too.”

Apple today revealed the 2021 App Store Award winners, recognizing the 15 best apps and games that helped users tap into personal passions, discover creative outlets, connect with new people and experiences, and simply have fun. This year’s winners include developers from around the world whose apps and games were selected by Apple’s global App Store editorial team for delivering exceptional quality, innovative technology, creative design, and positive cultural impact.
“The developers who won App Store Awards in 2021 harnessed their own drive and vision to deliver the best apps and games of the year — sparking the creativity and passion of millions of users around the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “From self-taught indie coders to inspiring leaders building global businesses, these standout developers innovated with Apple technology, with many helping to foster the profound sense of togetherness we needed this year.”

UPDATE
Apple teams up with Boys & Girls Clubs of America to bring new coding opportunities to young learners across the country
In celebration of Computer Science Education Week, Apple and Boys & Girls Clubs of America today launched a new program that will bring coding to Boys & Girls Clubs in more than a dozen US cities. This new collaboration will bring coding with Swift to tens of thousands of students across the country, building on Apple’s existing partnership with Boys & Girls Clubs of America through the company’s Community Education Initiative in support of itsRacial Equity and Justice Initiative.
Using iPad and Apple’s free Everyone Can Code curriculum — and with ongoing professional support from Apple educators — kids and teens at local Boys & Girls Clubs will integrate coding into their programming, giving students the opportunity to create and collaborate on the basics of app design and development, with an emphasis on critical thinking and creative problem-solving.
“At Apple, we believe education is a force for equity, and that all learners should have the opportunity to explore and develop coding skills for their future,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Together with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, we’ve already introduced thousands of students to innovative technology experiences, and we are thrilled to expand our partnership to bring coding with Swift to even more communities across the country.”
“Boys & Girls Clubs of America is committed to helping youth reach their full potential, which includes equipping young people with critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will serve them for years to come,” said Jim Clark, Boys & Girls Clubs of America’s president and CEO. “We are thrilled to partner with Apple to enhance Club programming with innovative and educational coding activities that will build kids’ and teens’ engagement and opportunity in technology.”
The program will initially launch in 10 new regions, including Atlanta; Austin, Texas; metro D.C.; Miami-Dade County, Florida; Wake County, North Carolina; and Silicon Valley, with the goal of expanding coding opportunities to clubs nationwide. Programming has already launched in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Chicago; Detroit; Nashville, Tennessee; and Newark, New Jersey, where engagement will continue to expand.
In New Jersey, Boys & Girls Club of Atlantic City opened a Design Lab and a STEAM Lab last year to support creativity, coding, and career development programming — and the Club is opening a second STEAM Lab in January to create additional opportunities for young learners. The labs are equipped with iPad and Mac computers, and curricula incorporate Everyone Can Code, Everyone Can Create, and Develop in Swift. To prepare its students for future academic and professional pursuits, the Club is also launching a new STEAM preapprenticeship program that will teach students the foundations of working on iPad and Mac, eventually giving them the tools to seek a formal App Development with Swift certification.
“Working with Apple this past year has been transformative for our students, who have had the opportunity to explore entirely new ways of thinking, creating, and pursuing their passions,” said Stephanie Koch, Boys & Girls Club of Atlantic City’s CEO. “The young people we work with are the future of Atlantic City, and we’re proud to partner with Apple to help them gain new skills to grow as learners and prepare for jobs in the 21st-century economy.”
In Detroit, Apple helped support Boys & Girls Clubs of Southeastern Michigan’s summer Code to Career coding course and app challenge. The program brought together young adults ages 18 to 24 to learn the foundations of human interface design and the Swift coding language, using Apple’s Everyone Can Code curriculum. Students worked in small groups to create app prototypes designed to solve a challenge within the community — including fashion sustainability, using hip-hop to build a sense of community, and improving city mobility. The club is now expanding this work further, bringing new devices and coding programming to its 11 locations across Greater Detroit.
Today’s announcement builds on a 2020 initiative through which Apple donated 2,500 devices to Boys & Girls Clubs of America locations in Alabama; Arizona; California; Connecticut; Georgia; Idaho; Illinois; Louisiana; Massachusetts, Michigan; Minnesota; New Jersey; New York; Ohio; Oregon; Pennsylvania; Tennessee; Texas; Washington, D.C.; and Wisconsin.

Apple marks a year of giving in the communities it calls home
Employee donation and volunteering program raises nearly $725 million over the last decade
For a few hours every week, Apple corporate team member Mandy Hazen logs onto the Crisis Text Line platform from her home in Fremont, California, and starts to chat with people across the country who are dealing with difficult personal situations.
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, the longtime Apple volunteer started looking for ways to keep helping others remotely and discovered the organization, which anonymously connects those in crisis to a volunteer who has been trained by professionals to listen and offer support. Since joining in March 2020, Hazen has logged more than 400 hours of texting as part of Apple’s Employee Giving program; Apple matches every hour an employee volunteers, or dollar they donate, with a monetary donation to the same organization.
“It makes me so happy that Apple helps to magnify the time I put into this,” says Hazen. “The money goes to such an amazing organization that is meeting people where they are during a really difficult time.”
Over the course of her volunteering, she’s helped to counsel hundreds of people who are dealing with situations like depression, domestic abuse, and isolation, and — when needed — connect them with professional help and resources.
“It has made me realize that sometimes people need someone to lean on to help them through a tough time,” says Hazen, “but they know that we’re there to talk to them and that’s their strength that gets them through to the next day.”
Across the United States and around the world, Apple and its employees are finding new ways to give back to the communities they call home.
This year, Apple’s Employee Giving program celebrates its 10th anniversary, having raised nearly $725 million for 39,000 organizations worldwide — with over $120 million distributed to organizations around the globe in 2021 alone. The funds raised through Apple’s Employee Giving program include the work of 68,000 employees who have logged almost 2 million volunteer hours.
In addition to the contributions made through the Employee Giving program, Apple’s Community Investment team donates millions of dollars each year to nonprofits around the globe, including World Central Kitchen, The King Center, and China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation.
Apple also donates millions of dollars annually through its Strengthen Local Communities (SLC) grant program, which provides funding to local organizations in the communities where Apple team members live and work.
At St. Bartholomew’s Church in midtown Manhattan, a long line of men and women queue for food. This soup kitchen runs seven days a week, no matter the weather, and hasn’t missed a night in 36 years.
It’s part of the Grand Central Food Program, one of the many services provided by the Coalition for the Homeless, which supports the needs of New York City’s most vulnerable. Apple is helping to fund the Coalition’s work through SLC grants.
Juan De La Cruz is the director of the Grand Central Food Program and has seen the number of people served at St. Bart’s go from about 150 per night before COVID-19, to as high as 425 per night during the pandemic.
“A lot of support programs closed down and so we’ve seen people coming from as far away as Staten Island because this is the one place that they know — rain or shine — there’s going to be a meal for them,” says De La Cruz. “We’ve been able to continue providing these meals because of support from so many organizations, including Apple and its employees, and that means the world to us.”
Tom Sheppard has been an Apple Store team member in New York City since 2009. His three youngest children all attended Public School 41 (P.S. 41) in the Bronx, and Sheppard began volunteering to help give them the same opportunities that students at other schools enjoyed. During a period of three years, he volunteered an astounding 1,000 hours. In the first year alone, that amounted to a $10,000 donation from Apple matching his time through the Giving program.
“Find the thing you’re passionate about, figure out how you can share that with other people, and then see how Apple can help you amplify sharing it,” says Sheppard, who also started programs that included an iPad photo club and a course to help parents get their high school diploma. “Sharing my love of technology was so important because it was exposing these kids to something they didn’t have access to before — and maybe that opens up a future of more opportunity.”
LaToya Reed’s children also attend P.S. 41 and she met Sheppard through his volunteer efforts. She was so inspired by his work that she decided to start volunteering as well.
“Mr. Sheppard has made the kids feel comfortable to step out of their comfort zone, and get excited about technology,” says Reed. “He pushes me to be a better me when it comes to the kids. He pushes me to always go the extra mile because the kids deserve it — and so I want to continue the work he did and make sure it keeps going.”
In Austin, Texas, SLC grants support the work of the African American Youth Harvest Foundation (AAYHF), which provides community-based resources for African American and low-income youth and families. That includes mentoring and counseling programs for at-risk youth, and a variety of other initiatives that take a holistic approach to care.
“We want to find out what’s going on at home, what’s going on in school,” says Michael Lofton, AAYHF’s CEO. “Are your lights on? Do you have food? Do you have clothes? Does anybody need mental health or substance abuse counseling? Because if we’re going to be successful, we’ve got to make sure the environment that surrounds someone is okay as well.”
This year, Apple’s funding went to AAYHF’s COVID-19 response, including a program to help raise vaccination rates by recruiting high school students to go door to door in their communities.
“Thanks to Apple, we are putting boots on the ground,” says Lofton. “We’re paying young people $17 an hour to go to apartment complexes and help others go and get vaccinated. These are predominantly African American communities and these kids are making a real difference — sometimes if you live in an environment where there is stress, where there is always a need, it makes a difference when you can give back and help somebody.”
Cork, Ireland, is home to the organization Nasc, which is the Irish word for link. Nasc works to support migrants and refugees in Ireland, and offers a number of different resources including the Gateway program for women, which is supported by Apple’s SLC grants.
“Our aim is to meet women where they are and promote self-confidence, self-esteem, and inclusion,” says Claire Mackey, Gateway’s project coordinator. “Apple has helped to keep the project running, and has given us the flexibility to be creative with how we support women. It’s given us the reassurance that we can maintain the work, and that means so much to us and to the people we’re helping.”
There are currently 40 women from 14 different countries in the program, and they are often matched with volunteers to help with learning English, and to foster a sense of connection. Saba, from Jordan, was paired with Apple employee and volunteer Barbara Ito, who is originally from Japan but is now based in Singapore. The women spoke once a week for months.
“I talked to her about everything,” says Saba. “She asked me every call: ‘How are you feeling today?’ Because of COVID, sometimes I’ve been sad and she’s helped to make me hopeful and happy.”
“We could find common things to talk about, even though we come from different backgrounds,” says Ito. “This opportunity meant a lot to me — I think it’s important that people around the world learn from each other and take care of each other.”

UPDATE
Apple Fitness+ introduces new ways to motivate people toward their goals with Collections, Time to Run, and more starting January 10
New Time to Walk guests and Artist Spotlight workouts also join Fitness+
Apple Fitness+, the first fitness and wellness service built entirely around Apple Watch and designed to be welcoming to all, is introducing Collections and Time to Run on January 10. Collections are a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organized to help users reach a goal, and Time to Run is an audio running experience designed to help users become more consistent and better runners, featuring popular running routes in some of the most notable cities.
“At the beginning of a new year, we know many people are looking for new ways to go after their goals. With these new additions, Fitness+ makes it easy to get motivated and stay active anywhere, with the most complete library of high-quality and diverse content to train your mind and body, no matter where you are on your fitness journey,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of Fitness Technologies. “We can’t wait for people to get motivated to reach their goals with Collections, and inspired by Time to Run’s exploration of iconic cities with rich running history.”
The same day, Fitness+ will also introduce the third season of Time to Walk featuring guests such as Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, and Hasan Minhaj, as well as new Artist Spotlight workouts featuring music from Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira, and the Beatles.
“For me, a great playlist can make or break a workout,” said Shakira. “Music has that power to energize you and make it more fun, so I hope these playlists can be inspiring for the Apple Fitness+ users who choose them too!”
Collections
Fitness+ will introduce Collections, a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organized to help users reach their goals. Drawing from almost 2,000 studio-style workouts and guided meditations available in Fitness+, Collections will provide users with an entirely new way to get motivated as they begin their next workout or meditation. Collections will include a suggested plan to help users make intentional training choices over the next several days or weeks.
The following six Collections will be available at launch:
Time to Run
Running is one of the most popular activities that can be done anytime, anywhere, with benefits like improved cardio fitness, a better mood, and stress relief. Time to Run on Fitness+ is a new audio running experience designed to help users become more consistent and better runners, with each episode focused on a popular running route in some of the most notable and iconic locations.
Each episode is composed of inspiring coaching tips led by one of the Fitness+ trainers users know and love, including Emily Fayette, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Sam Sanchez, and Scott Carvin, as well as one new running trainer, Cory Wharton-Malcolm. Wharton-Malcolm, who is renowned for championing inclusivity in the running community, ran his first marathon in 2007, and now he embarks on running adventures all over the world. His lively coaching makes even the hardest run feel playful.
Time to Run episodes also feature motivational and energizing music, with playlists curated by the Fitness+ trainers. The playlists are designed to match each run’s intensity, location, and coaching, capturing the spirit of the city where the run takes place. For example, the playlist for Miami Beach features Latin music inspired by the vibrant sights and sounds of the city. Users can also save the playlists to listen to anytime. During Time to Run, users will also receive photos taken by the Fitness+ trainer of notable sights along their route. Photos will be available in the workout summary afterward, and users can save them to their photo library or share with others.
Time to Run will launch with three episodes: London, coached by Cory Wharton-Malcolm; Brooklyn, coached by Emily Fayette; and Miami Beach, coached by Sam Sanchez. One new episode of Time to Run will be released each week on Mondays. Runners of all levels can enjoy Time to Run and stay motivated on their route from start to finish.
Time to Run joins a growing portfolio of Fitness+ audio experiences, including Time to Walk and Meditation, that can easily be done anytime, anywhere — all users need is an Apple Watch and AirPods, or other Bluetooth-enabled headphones. Time to Run can be experienced outside or inside on a treadmill, and episodes will be available in the Workout app on Apple Watch with a Fitness+ subscription. For Apple Watch customers who use a wheelchair, Time to Run becomes Time to Run or Push, and once selected, it gives users the choice to start a run or an Outdoor Push Running Pace workout.
Time to Walk
Starting January 10, Fitness+ will introduce the third season of Time to Walk, an inspiring audio experience on Apple Watch designed to encourage people to get active by walking more often. Time to Walk features some of the world’s most interesting and influential people, who share stories, photos, and music with Fitness+ subscribers. Time to Walk has featured 41 guests to date, including Dolly Parton, Anthony Joshua, Jane Fonda, Randall Park, Camila Cabello, Naomi Campbell, Ruby Bridges, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Bebe Rexha, and many others. Most recently, His Royal Highness Prince William closed out the second season talking about the importance of keeping mentally fit.
As the series begins its third season, new guests will be added each week. Starting January 10, users can walk with actor, writer, and producer Rebel Wilson. In her episode, she recalls an acting lesson that became a great life lesson, and how an unexpected connection provided comfort after she lost a loved one.
Some of the additional Time to Walk guests in Season 3 will include:
Artist Spotlight
Additionally, Fitness+ will add to the popular Artist Spotlight series with new workouts featuring the music of Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira, and the Beatles. The series dedicates an entire workout playlist to a single artist. Every Monday for four weeks, new workouts featuring music by each of these artists will appear in the service across different modalities. Workout types include Cycling, Dance, HIIT, Strength, Treadmill, and Yoga, across music genres such as Chill Vibes, Everything Rock, Hip-Hop/R&B, Latin Grooves, and Upbeat Anthems.

UPDATE
Apple services enrich peoples’ lives throughout the year
In 2021, Apple’s services helped deliver innovative apps, powerful content, and transformative experiences that enrich users’ lives around the world in more ways than ever before.
Apple Fitness+ coached users to stretch, lift, lunge, and meditate their way to healthier days; Apple News kept them informed of pivotal developments in the news and culture; and users started to reexplore the world using the beautiful new Apple Maps. Dozens of groundbreaking originals from Apple TV+ were streamed with family and friends near and afar using SharePlay; hundreds of fun, new and classic games were played on Apple Arcade; and millions of apps were downloaded from the App Store, unlocking powerful ways to communicate, collaborate, and connect. Podcasts like “The Midnight Miracle” and “We Can Do Hard Things” uplifted listeners, books like “The Least of Us” and “The Love Hypothesis” moved readers, and when the sun set at the end of each week, and the Work Focus switched off, it was time to celebrate with the Apple Music Award-winning… “ladies and gentlemen, The Weeknd.”
“Apple’s world-class portfolio of services proved essential in 2021, as people worldwide sought new ways to keep entertained, informed, connected, and inspired,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “With over 745 million paid subscriptions, Apple continues to connect the world’s developers, artists, and storytellers with users across more than a billion devices, delivering powerful tools, content, and experiences that enrich their lives in profound ways every day.”
Now it’s time to reflect on the best of 2021 and look ahead to some of the great new games, music, movies, TV shows, workouts, stories, podcasts, books, guides, and other experiences that await customers in 2022.
Apps and games have become the essential source for the world’s most innovative and timely entertainment. The efforts, innovation, and creativity of the developers who leverage Apple technology to build these incredible experiences, coupled with the power of theApp Store’s global platform to connect businesses of all sizes with over 600 million people each week across 175 countries, has led to developers selling digital goods and services earning more than $260 billion since the App Store launched in 2008. This significant number sets a new yearly record for App Store developer earnings while representing just a small fraction of theoverall commercethe App Store facilitates, serving as one meaningful marker of how the ecosystem continues to create opportunities and drive economic expansion for entrepreneurs around the world. This holiday season alone, App Store customers spent more than ever before between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, driving double-digit growth from last year.
2021 brought a slate of blockbuster launches to the App Store, with the world’s leading entertainment companies choosing to premiere marquee movies like “Black Widow” from Disney+ and “Space Jam: A New Legacy” from HBO Max in-app on the same day as their theatrical release. And in October, the App Store launched In-App Events, timely events within apps and games such as game competitions, movie premieres, livestreamed experiences, and more. Standout moments from just the last few months included in-game events like “The Champions Have Arrived!” in “Clash Royale,” “Space Tour” in “Mario Kart Tour,” and “Pokémon GO Halloween Mischief” in “Pokémon GO,” while popular events such as TikTok’s “Stranger Things Watch Party” and ESPN’s “Man in the Arena: Tom Brady” drew in-app crowds.
Whether through games that exploded onto the scene to become global sensations like “Royal Match” from Istanbul’s Dream Games, or social apps like Clubhouse, which opened up fascinating conversations to everyone this summer, many of the year’s most popular apps and games found new and creative ways to bring people everywhere together. Apps like Bumble and EatOkra were recently honored among the2021 App Store Awardswinners for delivering best-in-class app experiences, embodying the year’s trend of connection.
Lists of the year’s most downloadedappsandgamesare available on the App Store.
Last year,Apple Arcade’s award-winning library of games saw its biggest expansion yet, now offering players of all ages over 200 premium, family-friendly games, including brand new releases from the world’s best developers, award-winning titles, and beloved favorites from the App Store — all without ads or in-app purchases.
Now, subscribers can enjoy original games like “Sneaky Sasquatch,” “NBA 2K22 Arcade Edition,” “The Oregon Trail,” and the recently released “LEGO Star Wars: Castaways” and “Disney Melee Mania.” Players can also jump into award-winning titles like “Monument Valley,” “Mini Metro,” and “Galaga Wars,” and revisit timeless classics such as “Solitaire by MobilityWare” and “Good Sudoku by Zach Gage.”
Apple Arcade games support Apple’s high user privacy standards, and can be shared with up to five family members using Family Sharing with just one all-inclusive subscription.

New features including autoplay, lyrics share, city charts, motion cover art, enhanced search, Shared with You, and the redesigned Listen Now tab make the experience of discovering music a delight, while Apple Music TV on the Apple TV app, Apple Music in Apple News, and support for Apple Music across FaceTime with SharePlay, Apple Fitness+, and Memories in Photos extend the experience across the Apple ecosystem.
Apple Music Radio — which includes Apple Music 1, Apple Music Hits, and Apple Music Country — delivers an award-winning music listening and discovery experience to tens of millions of subscribers worldwide, with exclusive radio shows from the most beloved artists and well-respected hosts in the business.

Apple Music also hosted a series of culture-moving livestreams, including Kanye West’s “Donda” release streams; “Rap Life Live” with Moneybagg Yo, Saweetie, and Lil Durk; and the expanded Apple Music Awards featuring The Weeknd, Olivia Rodrigo, H.E.R., Wizkid, Scriptonite, Aya Nakamura, RIN, and OFFICIAL HIGE DANDISM, helping fans stay connected to these history-making moments in music across the globe.

In a first for music streaming, and as part of Apple’s ongoing mission to support the global artist community, Apple Music leveraged Shazam’s unmatched technology to identify the creators featured in the thousands of popular DJ mixes available on the service so that they can be compensated for their contributions. Apple Music also launched support for record label pages to help listeners find more great music from those behind the artists they already enjoy. Later this year, listeners can look forward to even more global premieres, exclusives, in-depth interviews, livestreams, DJ mixes, and the world’s best streaming experience for classical music with the most beloved features ofPrimephonic, plus even better browsing and search capabilities, detailed displays of classical music metadata, and much more.

Apple Watch
Apple is launching a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and matching Unity Lights watch face inspired by Afrofuturism, a philosophy that explores the Black experience through a narrative of science, technology, and self-empowerment. As part of this launch, Apple is supporting organizations focused on advancing inclusion in science and technology for communities of color through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.
Designed by members and allies of the Black creative community at Apple to celebrate Black history and culture, the Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and matching Unity Lights watch face honors generations of Black people across the African diaspora. This design symbolizes a communal belief in the necessity for a more equitable world. The vibrant red and green colors of the Pan-African flag appear like speckled light across the black band.
The band is complemented by the Unity Lights watch face, which is designed using 2D ray tracing, a technology never before implemented for a watch face. Each pixel on the screen simulates the light and shadow falling across it and the movement of the clock hands simultaneously reveal and hide the light, changing dynamically throughout the day. The Unity Lights watch face can be customized to be a full screen or circular dial, and includes a black and white option, tick marks, and up to four complications. iPhone, iPad, and Mac users can also show their support for Black History Month by downloading Afrofuturism-inspired wallpapers available atapple.com.

January 31, 2022
UPDATE
Apple celebrates Heart Month with new resources across services
New Apple Watch Activity Challenge and lifestyle insights from the Apple Heart and Movement Study
Apple is rolling out a series of new heart health resources in February to support users’ health journeys in the US to stay moving and informed. Additionally, the Apple Heart and Movement Study is sharing preliminary lifestyle trends analyzed over the past year.
Marking Heart Month, Apple is offering custom compilations across Apple Fitness+, the App Store, the Apple TV app, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books.
“We’re strong believers at Apple that if you can empower people with information about their health, you can change the trajectory of their well-being,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Keeping your heart healthy requires a holistic approach — something we’ve focused on since the first generation of Apple Watch with the inclusion of activity and workout apps, in addition to heart rate. Today, people of all ages can use our products and services to learn more about staying healthy, work toward their personal goals, and have a lot of fun along the way.”
To help Apple Watch users stay motivated, Apple is offering a new Heart Month Activity Challenge to help people of all fitness levels put their health first by completing 30 minutes in their Exercise ring on February 14 to earn a special award. Also starting February 14, to help users earn the award and stay active, Fitness+ will feature a special section of 30-minute energizing workouts that will motivate users to get their weekly minutes of exercise.
On the App Store, users can find a collection of apps that help them take care of their cardiovascular health by providing valuable insights into their heart rate and activity levels. Apps like HeartWatch (Tantsissa), Gentler Streak (Gentler Stories), and Zones (Flask) can empower users to optimize their fitness and overall wellness by accessing personalized workouts, monitoring key heart rate metrics, and tracking health vitals.
Apple Books is offering a collection of titles that focus on heart health, including books on heart science, emotional well-being, and healthy eating.

New Apple Heart and Movement Study Updates
In a new preliminary analysis of activity data shared from the Apple Heart and Movement Study,2researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, in collaboration with the American Heart Association and Apple, found that after analyzing more than 18 million workouts logged using Apple Watch during the pandemic, study participants relied on getting their activity minutes in by walking, cycling, and running the most. They also found that participants ages 65 and older were actually more likely than their younger counterparts to stay on track, meeting their goal of at least 150 minutes of activity per week.
Across genders and ages, participants with above-average Cardio Fitness levels averaged more than 200 minutes of activity per week, while those with high Cardio Fitness averaged more than 300 minutes of activity per week.
As his team learns more about the science behind these trends in activity and how they relate to cardiovascular fitness, Calum MacRae, MD, PhD, principal investigator of the Apple Heart and Movement Study, cardiologist, and professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, highlighted, “Much of what we know about activity and cardiovascular fitness is based on small studies with limited metrics and few data on trends over time. The Apple Heart and Movement Study is collecting ongoing detailed information on activity and health from a large number of participants using Apple Watch, which offers researchers an ongoing estimation of Cardio Fitness, an established measurement of cardiovascular fitness. Through this study, we’re able to analyze the interaction between activity and Cardio Fitness and follow trends in ways that were not previously possible. We anticipate that exploring physiology at this scale with such a rich research data set will shed light on wellness and maintaining health.”
People can learn more about the Apple Heart and Movement Study by downloading theResearch appfrom the App Store. Apple is also collaborating with additional research institutions to conduct heart health studies to explore how Apple Watch can help drive even greater scientific discoveries. They include theHeartline StudyandUniversity Health Network’s Heart Failure Study.
Tools for Staying Heart Healthy Throughout the Year
Apple Watch users can better understand their own heart health and be alerted of potential irregularities to discuss with their physician with insights from powerful tools like the ECG app, irregular rhythm notifications, high and low heart rate notifications, and Cardio Fitness levels.
For those just getting started with exercise and looking to live a healthier day, Fitness+ offers Workouts for Beginners across workout types like Strength, HIIT, Yoga, Pilates, Dance, and Core. Trainers also demonstrate modifications in each workout so there is always someone to follow no matter a user’s ability, and workouts or meditations can be as short as 5 or 10 minutes, so it’s easy to get started. Walking is one of the healthiest activities in the world that can be done anytime, anywhere, with benefits like stress relief and improved cardiovascular health. On February 14, the latest episode of Time to Walk, an inspiring audio experience on Apple Watch designed to encourage people to get active by walking more often, will feature Georges St-Pierre, a former mixed martial arts champion widely considered one of the greatest in the sport. Fitness+ will also introduce a new episode of Time to Run, an audio running experience designed to help users become more consistent and better runners, inspired by the iconic neighborhoods and running routes of San Francisco.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple lands historic first Best Picture Oscar nomination for “CODA,” and secures six Academy Award nominations including Best Actor for Denzel Washington in “The Tragedy of Macbeth” and Best Supporting Actor for Troy Kotsur in “CODA”
Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today made history, landing six Academy Award nominations in several major categories, including Best Picture for “CODA”; Best Actor for Denzel Washington in “The Tragedy of Macbeth”; Best Supporting Actor for Troy Kotsur in “CODA”; Best Adapted Screenplay for writer/director Siân Heder for “CODA”; Best Cinematography for Bruno Delbonnel for “The Tragedy of Macbeth”; and Best Production Design for Stefan Dechant for “The Tragedy of Macbeth.”
With today’s nomination for “The Tragedy of Macbeth,” Denzel Washington breaks his own record with 10 total Oscar nominations, becoming among the most nominated actors ever and the most nominated Black man in history.
Apple Original Films’ “CODA” becomes the first motion picture starring a predominantly Deaf cast in leading roles to receive a Best Picture nomination, and Troy Kotsur becomes the first Deaf male actor to receive a nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category for his powerful performance.
Additionally, “CODA” writer/director Siân Heder earns her first-ever Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.
The news was announced today by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and winners for the 94th Annual Academy Awards will be revealed on Sunday, March 27, in Los Angeles, CA.
“Everyone at Apple thanks the Academy and congratulates all of our exceptional filmmakers and actors on their well deserved nominations,” said Zack Van Amburg, Apple’s head of Worldwide Video. “We are humbled by reaching this milestone of receiving a Best Picture nomination for ‘CODA,’ a groundbreaking motion picture that uplifts, entertains and transforms. We applaud the visionaries in front of and behind the camera who brought ‘CODA’ and ‘The Tragedy of Macbeth’ to life, powerful films that connect story with humanity and will resonate with audiences for generations to come.”
“We truly appreciate the Academy’s recognition of these special films and extraordinary performances,” said Jamie Erlicht, Apple’s head of Worldwide Video. “After watching audiences connect with these undeniably deserving films all over the world, it is rewarding to now see this diverse selection of Apple Original Films being honored at the highest level. We are grateful to have had the opportunity to collaborate with so many talented creative storytellers and send our warmest congratulations to all of the nominees.”
Apple received six total nominations for the 94th Annual Academy Awards as follows:
Since the debut of Apple TV+ just over two years ago, Apple’s series and films have earned 202 wins and 929 nominations, including recent recognition from the Academy Awards, SAG Awards, Critics Choice Awards, Critics Choice Documentary Awards, NAACP Image Awards, as well as past Daytime and Primetime Emmy Awards, plus more.
“CODA”
In addition to today’s three Academy Award nominations, the beloved film “CODA” continues its global streak of acclaim, recently earning BAFTA Award nominations, a PGA Award nomination and historic SAG Award nominations — making it the first film with a predominantly Deaf cast to receive a SAG Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. Since its global debut, the Apple Original film has also been honored with an unprecedented four awards at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, including, the Special Jury Award for Ensemble Cast, the Directing Award, the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize, and has received an AFI Award. “CODA” has also earned nominations for an NAACP Image Award, and nine nominations for the Hollywood Critics Association Awards.
Seventeen-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones) is the sole hearing member of a deaf family — a CODA, child of deaf adults. Her life revolves around acting as interpreter for her parents (Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur) and working on the family’s struggling fishing boat every day before school with her father and older brother (Daniel Durant). But when Ruby joins her high school’s choir club, she discovers a gift for singing and soon finds herself drawn to her duet partner Miles (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo). Encouraged by her enthusiastic, tough-love choirmaster (Eugenio Derbez) to apply to a prestigious music school, Ruby finds herself torn between the obligations she feels to her family and the pursuit of her own dreams.
“CODA” is written and directed by Siân Heder, produced by Vendome Pictures and Pathé, with Philippe Rousselet, Fabrice Gianfermi, Patrick Wachsberger and Jérôme Seydoux serving as producers, and Ardavan Safaee and Sarah Borch-Jacobsen as executive producers.
“CODA” is now streaming on Apple TV+.
“The Tragedy of Macbeth”
Since its global debut earlier this year, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” recently received nominations from the Screen Actors Guild, BAFTA and NAACP Image Awards, and more.
Written and directed by four-time Academy Award winner Joel Coen, “The Tragedy of Macbeth” is an Apple Original Films and A24 production starring two-time Academy Award winner Denzel Washington and four-time Academy Award winner Frances McDormand. The cast also includes Bertie Carvel, Alex Hassell, Corey Hawkins, Kathryn Hunter, Harry Melling, Brendan Gleeson and Moses Ingram.
Coen’s bold and fierce adaptation; a tale of murder, madness, ambition and wrathful cunning is based on the play by William Shakespeare, in which a Scottish lord becomes convinced by a trio of witches that he will become the next King of Scotland. His ambitious wife will do anything to support him in his plans of seizing power.
“The Tragedy of Macbeth” reunites frequent Coen collaborators including Bruno Delbonnel as cinematographer, Mary Zophres as costume designer and a score from Carter Burwell. In addition to directing, Coen produces the film alongside McDormand and Robert Graf.
“The Tragedy of Macbeth” is now playing in theaters and streaming globally on Apple TV+.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple empowers businesses to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone
Later this year, US merchants will be able to accept Apple Pay and other contactless payments simply by using iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone. The new capability will empower millions of merchants across the US, from small businesses to large retailers, to use their iPhone to seamlessly and securely accept Apple Pay, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets through a simple tap to their iPhone — no additional hardware or payment terminal needed. Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available for payment platforms and app developers to integrate into their iOS apps and offer as a payment option to their business customers. Stripe will be the first payment platform to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to their business customers, including the Shopify Point of Sale app this spring. Additional payment platforms and apps will follow later this year.
“As more and more consumers are tapping to pay with digital wallets and credit cards, Tap to Pay on iPhone will provide businesses with a secure, private, and easy way to accept contactless payments and unlock new checkout experiences using the power, security, and convenience of iPhone,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “In collaboration with payment platforms, app developers, and payment networks, we’re making it easier than ever for businesses of all sizes — from solopreneurs to large retailers — to seamlessly accept contactless payments and continue to grow their business.”
Once Tap to Pay on iPhone becomes available, merchants will be able to unlock contactless payment acceptance through a supporting iOS app on an iPhone XS or later device. At checkout, the merchant will simply prompt the customer to hold their iPhone or Apple Watch to pay with Apple Pay, their contactless credit or debit card, or other digital wallet near the merchant’s iPhone, and the payment will be securely completed using NFC technology. No additional hardware is needed to accept contactless payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone, so businesses can accept payments from wherever they do business. Apple Pay is already accepted at more than 90 percent of US retailers, and with this new capability, virtually every business, big or small, will be able to allow their customers to Tap to Pay on iPhone at checkout. Tap to Pay on iPhone will also roll out to Apple Store locations in the US later this year.
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s payment features. With Tap to Pay on iPhone, customers’ payment data is protected by the same technology that makes Apple Pay private and secure. All transactions made using Tap to Pay on iPhone are encrypted and processed using the Secure Element, and as with Apple Pay, Apple doesn’t know what is being purchased or who is buying it.
Apple will work closely with leading payment platforms and app developers across the payments and commerce industry to offer Tap to Pay on iPhone to millions of merchants in the US. Tap to Pay on iPhone complements and enhances the robust suite of payment and commerce tools that payment platforms and app developers provide to their merchant customers to help them run and grow their businesses. Tap to Pay on iPhone will work with contactless credit and debit cards from leading payment networks, including American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa.
“Whether you’re a salesperson at an internet-first retailer or an individual entrepreneur, you can soon accept contactless payments on a device that’s already in your pocket: your iPhone,” said Billy Alvarado, Stripe’s chief business officer. “With Tap to Pay on iPhone, millions of businesses using Stripe can enhance their in-person commerce experience by offering their customers a fast and secure checkout.”
Tap to Pay on iPhone will be available to participating payment platforms and their app developer partners to leverage in their software developer kits (SDKs) in an upcoming iOS software beta.

2022-02-10,Decrease,An update on AirTag and unwanted tracking,"Text of this article
February 10, 2022
APPLE STATEMENT
An update on AirTag and unwanted tracking
AirTag lets users keep track of personal items like their keys, wallet, purse, backpack, luggage, and more through the Find My app. Since AirTag’s launch last April, users have written in to share countless stories of AirTag being instrumental in reuniting them with the things they value. Thanks to AirTag and the Find My app, a customer who lost his wallet on the subway was able to track it down at a station across town. With the help of an AirTag placed inside a medical kit, a parent whose child lost critical medicine on the bus was later able to find it.
AirTag was designed to help people locate their personal belongings, not to track people or another person’s property, and we condemn in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products. Unwanted tracking has long been a societal problem, and we took this concern seriously in the design of AirTag. It’s why the Find My network is built with privacy in mind, uses end-to-end encryption, and why we innovated with the first-ever proactive system to alert you of unwanted tracking. We hope this starts an industry trend for others to also provide these sorts of proactive warnings in their products.
We’ve become aware that individuals can receive unwanted tracking alerts for benign reasons, such as when borrowing someone’s keys with an AirTag attached, or when traveling in a car with a family member’s AirPods left inside. We also have seen reports of bad actors attempting to misuse AirTag for malicious or criminal purposes.
Apple has been working closely with various safety groups and law enforcement agencies. Through our own evaluations and these discussions, we have identified even more ways we can update AirTag safety warnings and help guard against further unwanted tracking.
Working with Law Enforcement
We have been actively working with law enforcement on all AirTag-related requests we’ve received. Based on our knowledge and on discussions with law enforcement, incidents of AirTag misuse are rare; however, each instance is one too many.
Every AirTag has a unique serial number, and paired AirTags are associated with an Apple ID. Apple can provide the paired account details in response to a subpoena or valid request from law enforcement. We have successfully partnered with them on cases where information we provided has been used to trace an AirTag back to the perpetrator, who was then apprehended and charged.
Law enforcement has shared their appreciation for the assistance we’ve provided in helping them find the source of unwanted tracking. We’ve identified additional improvements we can make in the information we share and the educational resources we provide, and we will be taking action, including making updates to ourlaw enforcement documentation.
Advancements Coming to AirTag and the Find My Network
The following updates represent important steps Apple is taking:
We’re also investigating a series of updates that we plan to introduce later this year, including:
We design our products to provide a great experience, but also with safety and privacy in mind. Across Apple’s hardware, software, and services teams, we’re committed to listening to feedback and innovating to make improvements that continue to guard against unwanted tracking.

Program alumni have gone on to secure major funding rounds, garner awards and accolades, and successfully sell their companies in major acquisitions. Previous app participantBookSlothrecently became the first-ever acquisition of a female-led technology company in Puerto Rico.
More apps from Entrepreneur Camp alumni can be found on the App Storehere.
Meet the Developers
“Cuca Catch”BrazilApple Developer Academy graduates Matheus Kulick, Theo Caldas, and Kassio Veras wanted to find a way to use technology to promote Brazilian folklore and culture. They recently launched “Cuca Catch” on the App Store — a dynamic game that uses users’ facial expressions to help Cuca, Brazil’s most iconic witch, create potions.
Encantos: Play, Learn & GrowUnited StatesA few years ago, CEO andEncantosco-founder Steven Wolfe Pereira was looking for a way to share his Dominican culture with his kids, and embarked on the journey of launching a diverse content library. As his company grew to a full team, including developers Keith Elliott and Francine Walker, their focus has broadened to helping kids enhance their literacy and life skills through audio, video, books, and games from creators of underrepresented communities.
FalouBrazilWhen Gabriel Santos, Vitor Marques, and Matheus Medina held meetings in English, they noticed that conversation could be difficult for those who had studied the language in school, but didn’t have much practical speaking experience. They createdFalouto help people become conversational faster by walking through immersive travel simulations.
“Gamma Fighter”United StatesAn homage to ’80s-style games like “Space Invaders” and “Galaga,” “Gamma Fighter” is a retro-style arcade game created by solo developer Jorge Briones. Though game creation is a passion project that Briones initially picked up as a hobby, he now blogs about his “coding adventures,” in hopes of inspiring others to learn how to code.
MemoriaBrazilApple Developer Academy students Ana Bittencourt Vidigal, Djenifer Renata Pereira, and Gustavo Kumasawa want to evoke memories associated with digital photos the way old printed photo albums do. During camp, they’ll be working on Memoria, a sharable digital photo album that anchors photos to objects or surroundings, to help spark memories associated with the photos so they don’t get “lost” or forgotten on your iPhone camera roll.
Sinq: Your Fitness CompanionBrazil/PortugalHealth and wellness were always important passions for Apple Developer Academy alums Matheus Fogiatto, Rodrigo Giglio, and Daniela Aires dos Reis. They saw an opportunity in the market forSinq, an app that utilizes a customizable dinosaur character to act as a motivator buddy for fitness, and now, they are working to launch more group activities and challenges.
TripifyBrazilWhen founder Alexandre Morgado couldn’t find what he needed in a travel app, he started designing his own. With the help of fellow developer Thiago Imolesi, the team builtTripifyas a holistic travel app with features to plan trips, manage expenses, register memories, and log places visited.
Wakeout!Guatemala/United StatesWakeout!is a “movement therapy” app designed to get users off the couch or out of their desk chair with brief movement sessions throughout the day, no matter what their environments look like. Already hugely successful on the App Store, Wakeout! received an App Store Award in 2020. Since then, teammates Andres Canella, Pedro Wunderlich, and Dmitrijs Millers have added thousands of exercises to the platform and have even created a separate, but similar, offering for kids.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple unveils M1 Ultra, the world’s most powerful chip for a personal computer
Available in the all-new Mac Studio, M1 Ultra brings unprecedented performance to the desktop
Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today announced M1 Ultra, the next giant leap for Apple silicon and the Mac. Featuring UltraFusion — Apple’s innovative packaging architecture that interconnects the die of two M1 Max chips to create a system on a chip (SoC) with unprecedented levels of performance and capabilities — M1 Ultra delivers breathtaking computing power to the newMac Studiowhile maintaining industry-leading performance per watt. The new SoC consists of 114 billion transistors, the most ever in a personal computer chip. M1 Ultra can be configured with up to 128GB of high-bandwidth, low-latency unified memory that can be accessed by the 20-core CPU, 64-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine, providing astonishing performance for developers compiling code, artists working in huge 3D environments that were previously impossible to render, and video professionals who can transcode video to ProRes up to 5.6x faster than with a 28-core Mac Pro with Afterburner.1
“M1 Ultra is another game-changer for Apple silicon that once again will shock the PC industry. By connecting two M1 Max die with our UltraFusion packaging architecture, we’re able to scale Apple silicon to unprecedented new heights,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With its powerful CPU, massive GPU, incredible Neural Engine, ProRes hardware acceleration, and huge amount of unified memory, M1 Ultra completes the M1 family as the world’s most powerful and capable chip for a personal computer.”
Groundbreaking UltraFusion Architecture
The foundation for M1 Ultra is the extremely powerful and power-efficient M1 Max. To build M1 Ultra, the die of two M1 Max are connected using UltraFusion, Apple’s custom-built packaging architecture. The most common way to scale performance is to connect two chips through a motherboard, which typically brings significant trade-offs, including increased latency, reduced bandwidth, and increased power consumption. However, Apple’s innovative UltraFusion uses a silicon interposer that connects the chips across more than 10,000 signals, providing a massive 2.5TB/s of low latency, inter-processor bandwidth — more than 4x the bandwidth of the leading multi-chip interconnect technology. This enables M1 Ultra to behave and be recognized by software as one chip, so developers don’t need to rewrite code to take advantage of its performance. There’s never been anything like it.
Unprecedented Performance and Power Efficiency
M1 Ultra features an extraordinarily powerful 20-core CPU with 16 high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores. It delivers 90 percent higher multi-threaded performance than the fastest available 16-core PC desktop chip in the same power envelope. Additionally, M1 Ultra reaches the PC chip’s peak performance using 100 fewer watts.2That astounding efficiency means less energy is consumed and fans run quietly, even as apps like Logic Pro rip through demanding workflows, such as processing massive amounts of virtual instruments, audio plug-ins, and effects.
For the most graphics-intensive needs, like 3D rendering and complex image processing, M1 Ultra has a 64-core GPU — 8x the size of M1 — delivering faster performance than even the highest-end PC GPU available while using 200 fewer watts of power.3
Apple’s unified memory architecture has also scaled up with M1 Ultra. Memory bandwidth is increased to 800GB/s, more than 10x the latest PC desktop chip, and M1 Ultra can be configured with 128GB of unified memory. Compared with the most powerful PC graphics cards that max out at 48GB, nothing comes close to M1 Ultra for graphics memory to support enormous GPU-intensive workloads like working with extreme 3D geometry and rendering massive scenes.
The 32-core Neural Engine in M1 Ultra runs up to 22 trillion operations per second, speeding through the most challenging machine learning tasks. And, with double the media engine capabilities of M1 Max, M1 Ultra offers unprecedented ProRes video encode and decode throughput. In fact, the new Mac Studio with M1 Ultra can play back up to 18 streams of 8K ProRes 422 video — a feat no other chip can accomplish.4M1 Ultra also integrates custom Apple technologies, such as a display engine capable of driving multiple external displays, integrated Thunderbolt 4 controllers, and best-in-class security, including Apple’s latest Secure Enclave, hardware-verified secure boot, and runtime anti-exploitation technologies.
macOS and Apps Scale Up to M1 Ultra
Deep integration between hardware and software has always been at the heart of the Mac experience.macOS Montereyhas been designed for Apple silicon, taking advantage of M1 Ultra’s huge increases in CPU, GPU, and memory bandwidth. Developer technologies like Metal let apps take full advantage of the new chip, and optimizations in Core ML utilize the new 32-core Neural Engine, so machine learning models run faster than ever.
Users have access to the largest collection of apps ever for Mac, including iPhone and iPad apps that can now run on Mac, and Universal apps that unlock the full power of the M1 family of chips. Apps that have not yet been updated to Universal will run seamlessly with Apple’s Rosetta 2 technology.
Another Leap Forward in the Transition to Apple Silicon
Apple has introduced Apple silicon to nearly every Mac in the current lineup, and each new chip — M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, and now M1 Ultra — unleashes amazing capabilities for the Mac. M1 Ultra completes the M1 family of chips, powering the all-new Mac Studio, a high-performance desktop system with a reimagined compact design made possible by the industry-leading performance per watt of Apple silicon.
Apple Silicon and the Environment
The energy efficiency of Apple’s custom silicon helps Mac Studio use less power over its lifetime. In fact, while delivering extraordinary performance, Mac Studio consumes up to 1,000 kilowatt-hours less energy than that of a high-end PC desktop over the course of a year.5
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every chip Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.

Apple announces the new iPhone SE: a powerful smartphone in an iconic design
The most affordable iPhone features the powerful A15 Bionic, 5G, better battery life, improved durability, and a new camera system with advanced features like Smart HDR 4, Photographic Styles, and Deep Fusion
Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today announced iPhone SE, a powerful new iPhone in an iconic design, with exceptional capabilities and performance at an incredible price.iPhone SEcomes in a compact and durable design, and together with iOS 15, delivers a seamless user experience. The new iPhone SE features impressive upgrades including the performance of A15 Bionic, which powers advanced camera capabilities and makes nearly every experience better, from photo editing to power-intensive operations like gaming and augmented reality. Along with 5G, longer battery life, and improved durability, iPhone SE comes in three stunning colors — midnight, starlight, and (PRODUCT)RED.1iPhone SE will be available for pre-order this Friday, March 11, with availability beginning Friday, March 18.
“iPhone SE has been an incredibly popular choice with our existing users and for new iPhone customers, thanks to its iconic design, exceptional performance, and affordable price. This year we’ve built the most powerful and durable iPhone SE yet, with better battery life thanks to A15 Bionic, the same chip as our iPhone 13 lineup that also unlocks advanced camera features like Smart HDR 4, Photographic Styles, and Deep Fusion,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “And with 5G, iPhone SE gives users faster downloads and uploads, higher quality video streaming, real-time interactivity in apps, and much more. Delivering the latest generation of technology and performance at this price is something only Apple can do.”
Iconic Design with a 4.7-inch Display
iPhone SE is as durable as it is beautiful, and features an aerospace-grade aluminum and glass design, now with the toughest glass in a smartphone on the front and back — the same as on the back of iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13. Rated IP67 for water and dust resistance, iPhone SE is designed to protect against spills.2iPhone SE features the familiar Home button with Touch ID — an easy, private, and secure alternative for logging in to apps, authorizing App Store purchases, making Apple Pay transactions, and more.
A15 Bionic: The Ultimate Smartphone Chip
The power of Apple silicon delivers industry-leading performance and cutting-edge capabilities to iPhone. The lightning-fast A15 Bionic — introduced with iPhone 13 — comes to iPhone SE and makes nearly every experience better, from launching apps to handling demanding tasks with ease. A15 Bionic packs a powerful 6-core CPU, the fastest CPU in a smartphone, with two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores, making iPhone SE up to 1.8x faster than iPhone 8, and even faster compared to older models. The 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling faster machine learning computations for third-party applications, as well as unlocking features for iPhone SE like Live Text in the Camera app with iOS 15 and on-device dictation. Perfect for photography, gaming, and augmented reality experiences, A15 Bionic makes every action feel fluid.
Built for efficiency, A15 Bionic works in conjunction with the latest-generation battery chemistry and tight integration with iOS 15 to enable better battery life on iPhone SE. Even with its compact form factor and new technologies like 5G, iPhone SE has longer battery life than the previous-generation and older 4.7-inch iPhone models. iPhone SE is compatible with Qi-certified chargers for wireless charging, and also supports fast charging.3
New Camera Experience Powered by A15 Bionic
iPhone SE features an all-new camera system powered by A15 Bionic, with a 12-megapixel ƒ/1.8 aperture Wide camera that offers incredible computational photography benefits, including Smart HDR 4, Photographic Styles, Deep Fusion, and Portrait mode.4Introduced with iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13, Smart HDR 4 uses intelligent segmentation to apply different adjustments for color, contrast, and noise to the subject versus the background. This ensures faces are properly exposed in challenging lighting, and renders people in the same photo individually, with different adjustments optimized for lighting and skin tone for each person. Photographic Styles allows users to bring their personal photo preferences to every image while still benefitting from Apple’s multiframe image processing. Preset and customized preferences work across scenes and subjects, and unlike a simple filter, intelligently apply the right adjustments to different parts of the photo to ensure the important elements, like skin tones, are preserved. Deep Fusion uses advanced machine learning to do pixel-by-pixel processing, optimizing for texture, details, and noise in every part of the photo. The image signal processor in A15 Bionic delivers significantly improved videos with reduced noise, particularly in low light, with better white balance and truer skin tone.
5G Comes to iPhone SE
5G allows users to take advantage of the latest generation of wireless technology, with faster uploads and downloads, lower latency, and better experiences in more places — like seeing family with higher-quality HD FaceTime calls, even when on cellular data and not on Wi-Fi.5With iOS 15, SharePlay on 5G unlocks powerful shared experiences such as watching HDR movies or TV shows in sync with friends while on a FaceTime call. And Smart Data mode will intelligently conserve battery life by automatically shifting iPhone to LTE when 5G speeds are not needed. Support for 5G worldwide is growing, with more than 200 carriers in over 70 markets and regions supporting it by the end of the year.
Featuring iOS 15
iOS 15enhances the iPhone experience with more ways to stay connected, powerful updates that help users focus and explore, and intelligent features to get more done with iPhone. Now FaceTime calls feel more natural with spatial audio and a new Portrait mode, SharePlay delivers a way for users to share experiences with friends and family while on a FaceTime call, Focus helps users reduce distraction, notifications have been redesigned, and Live Text uses on-device intelligence to recognize text in a photo and allows users to take action. Apple Maps brings beautiful ways to navigate and explore the world with a three-dimensional city-driving experience and walking directions in augmented reality. Weather is redesigned with full-screen maps and more graphical displays of data, Wallet adds support for home keys and state IDs, and privacy controls in Siri, Mail, and more places across the system further protect user information.6
iPhone SE and the Environment
Like iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13, iPhone SE is designed to minimize its impact on the environment. iPhone SE is made with recycled materials, including 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in the Taptic Engine and audio magnets, 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine, and 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board. Redesigned packaging eliminates the outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025. iPhone SE meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and remains free of numerous harmful substances.

2022-03-15,Increase,Apple’s Impact Accelerator unlocks new opportunities for US businesses to speed environmental progress,"I’m committed to Detroit. It has had its challenges like most urban cities have, and I wanted to participate in its revitalization and return it to being a world‑class city.
Roderick Rickman, Rickman Enterprise Group’s chairman and CEO

Apple’s Impact Accelerator unlocks new opportunities for US businesses to speed environmental progress
Applications are open for its second Impact Accelerator class
Last fall, leaders of companies across the US participated in Apple’s inauguralImpact Accelerator— a three-month virtual program including customized training, along with access to Apple expert mentors and an expanding alumni community — to expand their opportunities within Apple’s supply chain. Launched in 2020 as part of Apple’sRacial Equity and Justice Initiative, the Impact Accelerator is designed to support equity and opportunity in the environmental sector for Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy, and aims to combat systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for the communities most impacted by climate change.
Following the program, Apple is working with several businesses from the Impact Accelerator’s first class — including Rickman Enterprise Group; Diversified Chemical Technologies, Inc.; Argent Associates; and the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority — as part of the company’s supply chain network. Applications for Apple’s second Impact Accelerator class are now open, and a new group of Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses will have the same opportunity.
“We cannot build a greener economy without building a more just one, where communities most impacted by environmental harms lead us toward solutions,” says Lisa Jackson, vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our Impact Accelerator models the approach we need — bringing bold, innovative, and diverse businesses together to speed progress to a carbon-neutral future.”
A Sense of Duty to His Community
For Roderick Rickman, chairman and CEO of Rickman Enterprise Group, applying to join Apple’s inaugural Impact Accelerator was an easy decision. He believes that everyone — citizens and corporations alike — share a social and physical responsibility in protecting the planet.
“Apple’s commitment to sustainability, its environmental commitment to our Earth, and its social responsibility to residents really excites and drives me to get involved,” Rickman says. “I’m so honored to be a part of the Impact Accelerator, and to be contributing to Apple’s ambitions of both environmental and social justice.”
A veteran-turned-environmental cleaning service provider to the automotive industry, Rickman has always been concerned about the impact corporations’ practices are having on the environment.
“I can remember back in the ’60s when car owners would change their own oil, and they would dispose of it in ways that were not kind to the earth,” Rickman recalls of his time growing up in Detroit, Michigan. “Today, that’s totally unheard of. As environmental concerns and issues evolved, we’ve always been sensitive toward the preservation of our environment.”
Born and raised in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Detroit, Rickman is the 11th of 12 children, and credits his large family for instilling a strong sense of pride, family values, and commitment to community. “It comes as second nature to me,” he says. “I’m committed to Detroit. It has had its challenges like most urban cities have, and I wanted to participate in its revitalization and return it to being a world-class city.”
Following participation in the first Impact Accelerator, Rickman Enterprise Group and Apple are exploring ways to infuse Rickman’s expertise in facility management, environmental waste management, and achieving zero waste-to-landfill for Apple’s facilities and products.
After several years serving in the US Army taught Rickman the value of teamwork and how to be proactive rather than reactive, he discovered a passion for leadership that he brought back to Rickman Enterprise Group in the way the company supports, trains, and takes care of its employees. It also instilled a sense of duty he believes business leaders have to their local communities.
“Environmental laws, regulations, and responsibilities change,” Rickman says. “As they change, we need to change with them and make sure that across the demographics of industries, we have common practice and common procedures as it relates to sustaining our Earth, our environment, and making sure everyone is responsible in the same way.”
An Opportunity to Add Value
In Detroit, a Great Lakes city where Karl C. Johnson Jr., president and chief financial officer of Diversified Chemical Technologies, Inc., says a tougher climate has always existed, and the effects of climate change are not always singular or easy to pinpoint. But since the city’s pinnacle as the automotive manufacturing leader in the world in the ’90s, neighborhoods are facing record flooding, disproportionate amounts of homelessness due to corporations moving their manufacturing facilities out of the city, and a lack of public transportation that would enable residents to explore job opportunities outside of the city limits.
“Detroit is no different than any other legacy Rust Belt city around the Great Lakes,” Johnson says. “I grew up in Cleveland seeing the wealth of opportunity of manufacturing jobs, and what happened when they left. Whatever time I have left — in a professional sense — I want to be focused on creating jobs because jobs create opportunity, and opportunity allows people to make choices.”
Diversified Chemical’s expertise in adhesives — its customers include 32 Fortune 500 companies, such as Kellogg’s, Nestlé, Colgate, Mondelēz, and several other consumer packaged goods companies — and its dedication to safer chemistry align closely with the goals of the Impact Accelerator.
Diversified Chemical partnered with its Impact Accelerator mentor to organize and formalize their safer chemistry initiative, and determine a path forward: developing entirely new adhesives for the consumer electronics industry that could potentially further increase the repairability and recyclability of products like those Apple manufactures, as well as a new line of industrial parts cleaners for the electronics sector that are safer, solvent-free, and ultimately better for the environment.
“There’s a finite amount of resources on this planet, and industry has not been as innovative as it could have been to help preserve some of those resources. Apple’s focus on safer chemistry as one of the many tenets of the Impact Accelerator gives us an opportunity to add value and become a more strategic partner to Apple and our customer base by innovating around our practices of sustainability,” Johnson says. “It has been a privilege and a great honor to participate in the inaugural class. We are proud to be an example of how large and smaller companies can work together for a common goal that has both a social imperative, and represents a sound, innovative, good business model.”
An Impact Where We Live and Work
Two thousand miles away, in Plano, Texas, Argent Associates’ president and CEO Betty Manetta also recognized an opportunity to become a strategic partner for its customers in various sectors — both in the technical and energy efficiency platforms it provides, as well as its focus on sustainability and diversity and inclusion.
For Manetta, the Impact Accelerator was an invaluable experience in how small businesses can grow beyond just sales, but for its people and the future of the company. Since participating in the class, Argent Associates has started working with Apple on equipment for the company’s data centers, which run on 100 percent renewable energy.
“As a Latina businesswoman in a very male-dominated industry, I feel so blessed to be part of this program,” Manetta says. “Apple is creating that funnel for the next generation of companies that they can help grow and scale.”
After immigrating to Elizabeth, New Jersey, from Argentina with her parents in the ’60s, and attending college at night while working for the Western Electric branch of AT&T, Manetta recognized that she could do more for the industry from the outside, and decided to start her own company.
“After spending 20 years in corporate America, both in international and local business, I needed to see how I can help fill the gaps I saw in the supply chain,” Manetta says. “I knew what was lacking, and as a Hispanic, woman-owned business, I could provide support that would increase revenue, cut logistics costs, and provide value added services while enhancing our Latinx business community.”
Since its early days as a value-added reseller of networking technologies, the company has evolved into other areas of expertise, including network installation for 5G wireless, engineering, equipment analysis, and turn-up and testing of various technologies and platforms. With all its logistics know-how, Manetta saw a rising need for reverse logistics as well: helping companies recycle and repurpose metals and increasingly obsolete technology from their consumer products and network equipment.
Argent has pioneered an AI-based, real-time data collection process at the edge of the network to assess energy consumption, and areas for reduction for its users. Everything from vulnerabilities, over usage, peak demands, and anomalies can be monitored using the company’s proprietary Aire Edge system.
“We fix gaps to bring savings to the supply chain,” Manetta explains. “Our vision is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits our communities and saves the environment. By creating an ecosystem that incorporates other diverse companies, we are making an impact where we work and live.”
As Ray Moya, chief operating officer and chief technology officer of Argent, describes, their commitment to diversity is a necessity for local communities, the businesses that operate in them, and the larger corporations developing next-generation technologies in the industry.
“We made a decision that we’re going to create the next generation of Black and Hispanic wireless engineers, network engineers, and installers,” Moya says. “We’re proud that we have a legacy of young professionals who are minorities that will one day become the leaders of our company.”
With operations spanning from Texas to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Georgia, North Carolina, and Florida, Manetta and Moya are furthering their reach and impact across local communities. Through partnerships with high schools, including the Harmony School of Innovation in Texas and the Synergy School of Tomorrow in Florida, Argent is heavily committed to presenting young people in underrepresented communities to new opportunities.
“We want to show young people that there are lots of opportunities in the field of technology and innovation,” Manetta says. “Local communities are the growth engine for most small businesses, and that is the growth engine of our economy. If we don’t invest in our community, we’ll never grow out of the issues that we’re having today.”

UPDATE
Apple announces new coaching program and features for educators
Applications open for Apple Learning Coach, with the new Apple Education Community coming this fall
Empowering educators with technology and resources is fundamental to Apple — that’s why professional learning has always been a key piece of Apple’s education offerings. Today, Apple is unveiling Apple Learning Coach, a new professional learning program for educators who coach teachers to get the most out of Apple technology. Additionally, the Apple Education Community, coming this fall, will be a new hub for Apple professional learning resources and a collaborative space where educators will be able to connect and share ideas. Apple also announced that Managed Apple IDs will integrate with Google Workspace, making it easy for users and IT to keep their organizational accounts in sync, along with updates coming to Apple’s Classroom and Schoolwork apps to help educators keep lessons engaging.
“We know that professional learning opportunities — from educators, for educators — make all the difference in unlocking the potential in every student. Apple Learning Coach is designed to do just that, and we are thrilled to offer this new program today,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Education and Enterprise Marketing. “We also look forward to bringing the new Apple Education Community online, as a vibrant space for educators to learn from and connect with one another, and we think educators are going to love the new features coming to Classroom and Schoolwork to make learning even more interactive.”
Apple Learning Coach is a free professional learning program that trains instructional coaches, digital learning specialists, and other coaching educators to help teachers effectively use Apple technology in the classroom. Through a mix of self-paced lessons and virtual workshop sessions with Apple Professional Learning Specialists, participants come away from the experience with an actionable portfolio, a cohort of peers, and the opportunity to apply for continuing education credits from Lamar University through the Texas Education Agency. Each Apple Learning Coach gains a deeper understanding of how to support teachers where they are, as they integrate technology into learning.
“Apple Learning Coach is one of the best professional development opportunities I’ve ever been through, and we’re already seeing the impact in our classrooms,” said Jessica Keller, who participated in a pilot of the program. Ms. Keller is an instructional technology specialist at Berkeley County Schools, a district of nearly 20,000 students in West Virginia. She previously taught first grade in the district and now coaches 10 technology integration specialists across 21 elementary schools. “As an example, after our coaching sessions, teachers have been using Clips to create videos with students. I’ve watched as they transitioned from focusing on how to use the technology, to focusing on learning outcomes and building on student success.”
The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE)published a report todaycertifying that Apple Learning Coach earns a Seal of Alignment to itscoaching standards. The report states that Apple Learning Coach “is well designed, highly professional in approach, easy to navigate,” and further notes that the program “contributes to the pedagogically robust use of technology for teaching and learning,” and demonstrates it does “consciously, purposefully and meaningfully support best practices for digital age teaching and learning.”
Apple also shared its intentions to launch the new Apple Education Community. The site will serve as the hub for Apple’s depth of professional learning programs — including Apple Teacher and Apple Learning Coach. It will feature the Learning Center educators know and love, and introduce the Forum, launching in beta, which will serve as a secure, collaborative space for educators to connect and learn from each other.
In addition, Apple announced a new feature coming to Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager: integration with Google Workspace identity services. Currently, Apple School Manager and Apple Business Manager support an integration with Microsoft Azure Active Directory. With this new integration, IT teams who use Google Workspace can experience the same benefits: directory sync and federated authentication. With directory sync, user records and Managed Apple IDs are created automatically, saving IT admins both time and effort. And with federated authentication, end users can sign in to their Managed Apple ID with their Google Workspace account, making for a seamless login experience to apps like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, Messages, FaceTime, and more.
Apple’s apps for education will also be adding important new features this spring. The Classroom app will add a new agendas feature that will enable educators to create time-based outlines for class, and trigger associated actions in the app. For example, after 20 minutes of free reading, educators can schedule a stretch break with their favorite app or YouTube video. This new capability is built right into the Classroom app, with a highly programmable interface that eliminates the need to use a separate timer app. With Apple’s Schoolwork app, educators will be able to add multimedia such as an audio recording or video into assignment instructions, exit tickets, and try-again messages to increase student engagement and facilitate comprehension, particularly for preliteracy learners.
Apple Learning Coach isaccepting applicationsfrom educators in the US through April 19. Apple School Manager will feature integration with Google Workspace this spring. The Classroom and Schoolwork app features are currently in beta and will be available widely this spring. For more details, visitAppleSeed for IT. The Apple Education Community will launch by this fall, and membership will be free for educators and users who sign in with an Apple ID.

March 23, 2022
UPDATE
Apple launches the first driver’s license and state ID in Wallet with Arizona
Additional states to follow, including Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio, and the territory of Puerto Rico
Apple announced that Arizona is the first state to offer driver’s license and state ID in Wallet. Starting today, Arizonans can add their driver’s license or state ID to Wallet, and tap their iPhone or Apple Watch to seamlessly and securely present it at select TSA security checkpoints in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
“We’re thrilled to bring the first driver’s license and state ID in Wallet to Arizona today, and provide Arizonans with an easy, secure, and private way to present their ID when traveling, through just a tap of their iPhone or Apple Watch,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “We look forward to working with many more states and the TSA to bring IDs in Wallet to users across the US.”
Additional states will offer driver’s license and state ID in Wallet soon. Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Ohio, and the territory of Puerto Rico plan to bring this feature to their residents, along with the seven states Apple previouslyannounced.
Adding a driver’s license or state ID to Wallet can be done in a few simple steps: Residents can tap the + button at the top of the screen in Wallet on their iPhone, select “Driver’s License or State ID,” and follow the on-screen instructions to start the setup and verification process. To help ensure that the person adding the identity card to Wallet is the same person to whom the identity card belongs, the user will be asked to take a selfie and scan the front and back of their driver’s license or state ID card, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. As an additional fraud prevention step, users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process. The state is responsible for verifying and approving the user’s request to add their driver’s license or state ID to Wallet.
Once added to Wallet, users can present their driver’s license or state ID to the TSA at participating airport security checkpoints by simply tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch at the identity reader. On their iPhone or Apple Watch, users will be shown which information is requested by the TSA, and can consent to provide it with Face ID or Touch ID, without having to unlock their iPhone or show their ID card. All information is shared digitally, so users do not need to show or hand over their device to present their ID. The TSA will also capture a picture of the traveler for verification purposes.
Driver’s license and state ID in Wallet takes full advantage of the privacy and security built into iPhone and Apple Watch, and offers benefits that a physical ID card can’t match. Unlike physical ID cards, driver’s license and state ID in Wallet presents only the information needed for the interaction, and the user has the opportunity to review and authorize the information being requested before it is shared. Additionally, driver’s license and state ID in Wallet is presented digitally through encrypted communication directly between the device and the identity reader, so users do not need to show or hand over their device. Biometric authentication using Face ID and Touch ID helps ensure that only the person who added the ID to the device can view or present their ID or license in Wallet. If users lose their iPhone or Apple Watch, they can use the Find My app to easily lock their device and help locate it, or remotely erase their device.
Driver’s license and state ID in Wallet is available on iPhone 8 or later running iOS 15.4, and Apple Watch Series 4 or later running watchOS 8.4 or later. Driver’s licenses and state IDs in Wallet are currently available for use in select states at select TSA checkpoints. Travelers should refer to TSA checkpoint signage to confirm availability.
More information about driver’s license and state ID in Wallet is available onapple.co/wallet-id.

March 24, 2022
UPDATE
Apple’s $4.7B in Green Bonds support innovative green technology
The company plans to use the world’s first commercial-purity low-carbon aluminum from ELYSIS in the iPhone SE
Investments from Apple’s $4.7 billion in Green Bonds have helped jump-start the development of new low-carbon manufacturing and recycling technologies, the company announced today. Apple has issued three Green Bonds since 2016, with projects showcasing how the investments can reduce global emissions and bring clean power to communities around the world.
As part of this work, Apple is purchasing direct carbon-free aluminum following a major advancement in smelting technology to reduce emissions. The aluminum is the first to be manufactured at industrial scale outside of a laboratory without creating any direct carbon emissions during the smelting process. The company intends for the material to be introduced in the iPhone SE.
“Apple is committed to leaving the planet better than we found it, and our Green Bonds are a key tool to drive our environmental efforts forward,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our investments are advancing the breakthrough technologies needed to reduce the carbon footprint of the materials we use, even as we move to using only recyclable and renewable materials across our products to conserve the earth’s finite resources.”
In total, Apple has issued $4.7 billion to accelerate progress toward the company’s goal to become carbon neutral across its supply chain by 2030. Its first two bonds in 2016 and 2017 are now fully allocated. The 2019 Green Bond is supporting 50 projects, including the low-carbon aluminum breakthrough. These 50 projects will mitigate or offset 2,883,000 metric tons of CO2e, install nearly 700 megawatts of renewable energy capacity around the world, and promote new recycling research and development.
Innovation in Green Aluminum Smelting
ELYSIS, the company behind the world’s first direct carbon-free aluminum smelting process, announced that it has produced the first commercial-purity primary aluminum at industrial scale for use in Apple products. The breakthrough technology produces oxygen instead of greenhouse gases, and the achievement marks a major milestone in the production of aluminum, one of the world’s most widely used metals. Apple will purchase this first batch of commercial-purity, low-carbon aluminum from ELYSIS for intended use in the iPhone SE. This aluminum was produced by ELYSIS at its Industrial Research and Development Centre in Quebec using hydropower.
Apple helped spur this revolutionary advancement in aluminum production through an investment partnership with Alcoa, Rio Tinto, and the governments of Canada and Quebec that began in 2018. The following year, Apple purchased the first-ever commercial batch of aluminum resulting from the joint venture, using it in the production of the 16-inch MacBook Pro.
“This is the first time aluminum has been produced at this commercial purity, without any greenhouse gas emission and at industrial scale. The sale to Apple confirms the market’s interest in aluminum produced using our breakthrough ELYSIS carbon-free smelting technology. Today’s announcement proves that ELYSIS, a joint venture between Alcoa and Rio Tinto, was able to turn an idea into reality,” said Vincent Christ, ELYSIS’s CEO. “We are excited to be working alongside Apple on this advancement, which has the potential to make lasting changes in how aluminum is produced.”
Today’s milestone builds on the significant progress Apple has made in reducing the carbon impact of aluminum and other metals found in its products. By switching to recycled aluminum and aluminum smelted using hydroelectricity instead of fossil fuels, the company’s carbon emissions associated with aluminum have decreased by nearly 70 percent since 2015. Every model in the iPad lineup, including the new iPad Air, along with the latest MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, and Apple Watch, are made with a 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosure.
Commitment to Clean Energy
Apple continues to use its Green Bonds — which are among the largest in the private sector — to develop new sources of renewable energy. More than $500 million of the company’s 2019 Green Bond proceeds have been allocated to clean energy projects. This includes the world’s largest onshore wind turbines, which power the company’s data center in Viborg, Denmark, with all surplus energy going back into the Danish grid.
Over the next year, Apple will expand the Viborg data center’s operations and build new infrastructure to capture excess heat energy for the city’s long-term benefit. As with its data centers, all Apple offices and retail stores across 44 countries have sourced 100 percent clean energy since 2018, including through Green Bond proceeds.
In 2021, Apple’s 2019 Green Bond helped support its Supplier Clean Energy Program, including allocations to training and resources to help guide suppliers in their transition to clean power, and policy advocacy efforts in Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea to help build cost-effective renewable energy markets. More than 175 manufacturing partners across 24 countries have now committed to using 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production, a critical milestone toward ensuring every Apple product has a net-zero climate impact.
For more information on Apple’s Green Bond efforts, visitinvestor.apple.com/Apple_GreenBond_Report.pdf. This year’s annual impact report covers the cumulative allocation of Apple’s 2019 Green Bond proceeds to environmental projects that incurred spend between September 29, 2019, and September 25, 2021 — Apple’s 2020 and 2021 fiscal years. Sustainalytics provided a second-party opinion on the selected projects, and Ernst & Young LLP provided an attestation report on the spend.

2022-03-30,Decrease,Apple launches $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund,"Text of this article
March 30, 2022
PRESS RELEASE
Apple launches $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund
To support expanded initiatives for people across its supply chain, Apple is partnering with the International Labor Organization, the International Organization for Migration, and education experts around the world
Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund that will expand access to learning opportunities and skills development. The fund also includes new and expanded partnerships with leading rights advocates, universities, and nonprofits to drive Apple’s ongoing work to empower supplier employees and drive improvements in knowledge of and respect for workplace rights across industries.
As part of the new $50 million commitment, and building on Apple’s long history in the space, the company is working alongside supply chain partners to amplify worker voice. That includes supporting the worker rights programs created by the International Labour Organization (ILO) for people in the electronics sector, and the work the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is doing to expand rights trainings and scale its industry-leading responsible labor recruitment tools.
“We put people first in everything that we do, and we’re proud to announce a new commitment to accelerate our progress and provide even more opportunities for people across our supply chain,” said Sarah Chandler, Apple’s senior director of Environment and Supply Chain Innovation. “Together with rights advocates and education leaders, we are continuing to drive new innovation to support people and the planet.”
“At IOM, we understand that supply chain responsibility is complex, and must be driven by innovation, results, and partnerships,” said Amy Pope, IOM’s deputy director general for Management and Reform. “Improving people’s lives must be at its core. The IOM and Apple partnership has proven results in Apple’s own supply chain and paves the way for others in the industry to follow. To effect real change, we need global collaboration that engages workers, NGOs, government, and industry. Apple’s new commitments will have tangible, meaningful benefits for workers around the world.”
Apple is also today releasing its 16th annualPeople and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report, which provides a comprehensive account of how Apple and its suppliers are supporting people across the company’s supply chain, transitioning to clean energy, and investing in cutting-edge technologies.
New Educational and Career Development Opportunities
Apple has offered in-person and virtual education, skill-building, and enrichment courses since 2008, providing opportunities for people in its supply chain to gain new technical and leadership skills. With the launch of the Supplier Employee Development Fund, Apple is significantly expanding the scope of these offerings, with new educational resources for people in its supply chain — and the surrounding communities — to develop the skills necessary for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
The new education initiatives will make trainings and coursework available to supplier employees around the world, with programming initially available to individuals in the US, China, India, and Vietnam. By 2023, Apple expects more than 100,000 supplier employees to participate in new learning opportunities — from leadership training and technical certifications to classes on coding, robotics, and advanced manufacturing fundamentals, including green manufacturing.
These new initiatives build on Apple’s long-standing commitment to invest in the people in its supply chain and drive manufacturing best practices around the world. To date, Apple’s supplier employee educational programming has reached more than 5 million people.
Expanding and Scaling Worker Rights Programs
As part of its Supplier Code of Conduct, Apple requires all suppliers to provide their employees with training on their workplace rights. To date, over 23 million people across Apple’s global supply chain have received critical worker rights training.
In partnership with the IOM and the ILO — United Nations agencies that advocate for worker rights — Apple will expand this work, creating new programs, trainings, and worker feedback mechanisms that help ensure a safe, respectful work environment for people across its supply chain.
As part of its new Supplier Employee Development Fund, Apple is also announcing a variety of new and expanded partnerships with labor rights experts, organizations, and UN agencies, including:

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Business Essentials now available for small businesses
Thousands of small businesses in the Apple Business Essentials beta reported significant time savings and renewed ability to focus on their mission
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced thatApple Business Essentialsis now available to all small businesses in the US. The new service brings together device management, 24/7 Apple support, and iCloud storage into flexible subscription plans. Apple also unveiled new AppleCare+ for Business Essentials options that can be added to any plan. Additionally, a two-month free trial will be available to all customers, including those who have been using Apple Business Essentials in beta.
“Apple has a deep and decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive. From dedicated business teams in our stores to the App Store Small Business Program, our goal is to help each company grow, compete, and succeed,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Enterprise and Education Marketing. “We look forward to bringing Apple Business Essentials to even more small businesses to simplify device management, storage, support, and repairs. Using this new service leads to invaluable time savings for customers — including those without dedicated IT staff — that they can invest back into their business.”
Apple Business Essentials supports small businesses throughout the entire device management life cycle — from device setup, to device upgrades — while providing strong security, prioritized support, and data storage and backup. The complete solution begins with simple employee onboarding, allowing a small business to easily configure, deploy, and manage Apple products from anywhere. With the Collections feature, groups of apps can be delivered to employees or teams, and settings can be automatically pushed to devices, such as VPN configurations, Wi-Fi passwords, and more.
Employees simply sign in to their work account on their iPhone, iPad, or Mac using a Managed Apple ID. Once they sign in, they will have access to everything they need to be productive, including the new Apple Business Essentials app, where they can download work apps available to them. Managed Apple IDs can be created by federating with Microsoft Azure Active Directory and, coming later this spring, with Google Workspace identity services, allowing employees to log in to their device with a single business username and password. Apple Business Essentials works with company-provided and personally owned devices, and with Apple’s User Enrollment feature, employees’ personal information stays private and cryptographically separated from work data.
In addition to a streamlined setup, Apple Business Essentials provides a dedicated iCloud work account for simple and secure storage, backup, and collaboration on files and documents. Business data is automatically stored and backed up on iPhone or iPad, making it easy to upgrade to a new device. And iCloud Drive keeps information synced across Mac, making it easy to move between devices at work.
AppleCare+ for Business Essentials
Beginning today, businesses have the option to add prioritized support for employee devices with AppleCare+ for Business Essentials. This service includes 24/7 access to phone support, training for both IT administrators and employees, and up to two device repairs per plan — by individual, group, or device — each year. Employees can initiate repairs directly from the Apple Business Essentials app, and an Apple-trained technician can come onsite in as little as four hours to get their iPhone back up and running.1
“Espresso machines are the last piece of food service equipment art, and the centerpiece of every cafe. We take pride in being part of the international coffee community with a superior customer experience in the Minneapolis area,” said Peter Kelsch, Espresso Services Inc.’s president. “I started this business in 1989 on Apple products, and now iPhone, iPad, and Mac are used across sales, operations, and service for our coffee equipment business. Apple Business Essentials makes deployment and security simple for our business as we continue to grow, and will reduce our IT management overhead and streamline our growth process. It’s going to be a game-changer for our business.”
Pricing and Availability
Apple Business Essentials is now available as a subscription for all small businesses in the US. Flexible plans can be customized to support each user and device in an organization with up to 2TB of secure storage in iCloud, starting at$2.99(US) per month after a two-month free trial. Plans that include AppleCare+ for Apple Business Essentials start at$9.99(US) per month. Sign up today atapple.com/business/essentials.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Myeongdong opens Saturday, April 9, in South Korea
Apple collaborates with renowned artists across all genres for new Today at Apple sessions celebrating Korean culture
seoul, south koreaApple today previewed Apple Myeongdong, a new retail store located in the center of Seoul’s vibrant and bustling shopping district. Serving as Apple’s largest store in South Korea, this new space will invite customers to discover Apple’s latest products, receive best-in-class support from highly knowledgeable Apple Specialists, and participate in educational Today at Apple sessions.
“We are thrilled to deepen our relationship with our Korean customers with the opening of this special store in Myeongdong,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “Our incredible retail team is ready to welcome the local community, and we invite everyone to find endless inspiration as they explore Apple’s innovative products and services.”
Apple Myeongdong will serve as a stage for established and new Korean artists, who will lead unique Today at Apple sessions celebrating contemporary Korean culture. The store will debut Apple’s first-ever K-pop Today at Apple Remix session featuring K-pop supergroup SEVENTEEN. The new session, set to launch in other Apple stores across Asia, will spotlight the band’s soon-to-be-released single, “Darl+ing,” arriving ahead of their full-length album that will debut in May. Attendees will discover more about the group’s creative process, and deconstruct the new track using iPad and GarageBand.
Apple is also collaborating with other artists for inspirational Today at Apple sessions celebrating Korean creativity in all forms:
Participants are able to register today atapple.com/kr/today/myeongdong.
The expansive two-level store is positioned at the base of an all-new tower in the center of the city, occupying the full width of the block and creating a grand street frontage. Offering visitors a small haven from the hustle of the busy street, landscaped pocket gardens flank both corners of the store, and include commissioned sculptures created by Korean artists Jaehyo Lee and VAKKI. The greenery flows into the space, with a shaded grove of trees lining the storefront. Apple Myeongdong also features the first installation of a horizontally supported double-height glass façade.
Once inside, customers can browse Apple’s latest products and services on the tables and avenues — including Apple TV+, following its recent launch in Korea. A newly dedicated Apple Pickup area, the first of its kind in Asia, makes it even more convenient to pick up products ordered online. Visitors can travel between floors using the staircase, which is made transparent through glass risers, or through the stainless steel elevator.
The second floor provides ample space to explore and receive support from the 220-person store team, which collectively speaks 11 languages and represents over eight nationalities. Integrating locally sourced hanji paper shades, the Boardroom offers an intimate setting where the store’s Business Team can offer advice and training to entrepreneurs, developers, and other business customers. The Forum, featuring a large video wall in the center, creates an elevated gallery with city views, and serves as the home to Today at Apple sessions.
Apple has been operating in South Korea for more than 20 years, and the company’s ongoing investments and innovation support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country. Since first opening Apple Garosugil in 2018, Apple has welcomed millions of visitors to its stores, and continues to provide opportunities to learn, create, and engage. Apple opened its Apple Developer Academy with POSTECH in March of this year, and applications opened earlier this week for the first-ever Apple Manufacturing R&D Accelerator.
Apple continues its strong commitment to customers in Korea by providing an incredible experience across products, software, and services. With the launch of Apple TV+, Apple unveiled its first Korean-language Apple Original series, “Dr. Brain,” along with its new Original series, “Pachinko,” and earlier this year, Apple worked with world-renowned director Park Chan-wook on a Shot on iPhone feature “Life Is But a Dream.”
The store will welcome its first visitors on Saturday, April 9, at 10 a.m. local time. With the health and well-being of customers and team members as Apple’s top priority, the store will implement comprehensive health measures, and visits to Apple Myeongdong on opening day will be by appointment only. Customers can visitapple.com/kr/myeongdongto choose from available times, and each non-transferable reservation admits one person.

UPDATE
Report finds third-party apps see global success on the App Store
A report by economists at Analysis Group found that third-party apps are among the most successful on the App Store, reaching massive global audiences with high engagement across many popular app types
Today, economists at Analysis Group published a new report on the proliferation of third-party apps on the App Store, with new insights into how third-party apps perform in categories ranging from maps to music streaming, among others. The report finds that third-party apps experience broad regional and global success on the App Store, demonstrating the breadth of opportunity for developers and the wide range of choice available to consumers around the world.
Since the App Store’s launch more than a decade ago, the number of third-party apps has grown from 500 to more than 1.8 million — compared to 60 apps offered by Apple (first-party apps). Today, more than 99.99 percent of iOS apps are made by third-party developers, fueling a growing and competitive marketplace that contributes to a dynamic experience for users to the benefit of Apple and third-party developers alike.
The report analyzes apps from Apple and third-party developers across many popular app types, breaking down regional and global top performers. It also highlights just how many channels developers now have to distribute their apps — from mobile platforms, to PCs, to video game consoles.
The report also offers a deep analysis on a wide variety of app types, from service-based apps that offer TV, movie, or music streaming, to core smartphone features like communication.
Some highlights from the report include:
Apple makes available a number of tools and core technologies to all developers to help them create innovative apps, including more than 250,000 software development building blocks called APIs. Developers can also access more than 40 Apple software development kits that let them harness the power of machine learning, augmented reality, and other cutting-edge technologies. These tools are provided to all developers in service of delivering users the widest variety of secure, useful, and innovative experiences possible on their Apple devices. And they’ve helped developers of all sizes to build best-in-class apps, and distribute them to a global audience. Apple frequently features third-party apps on the App Store, highlighting music streaming and communications apps — among many others — that offer services in categories where Apple offers its own alternatives.
Apple also invests in the next generation of developers with freely available tools including Swift Playgrounds and Xcode — both are supported by Everyone Can Code and Develop in Swift programs, which reached nearly 2 million students and educators in 2020 alone.
The report relies on outcome-based engagement metrics to analyze the success of third-party apps on the App Store, and finds that the most appropriate engagement measure depends on an app’s purpose and functionality. It also addresses how different usage measures can present different figures of success, and stresses the importance of making app comparisons within app categories.
The full Analysis Groupreport on third-party appson the App Store is now available.
The App Store, which launched in 2008, is the world’s safest and most vibrant app marketplace, currently offering 1.8 million apps and visited by more than 600 million people each week. Apple provides more than 30 million registered developers with all the tools, resources, and support they need to create and deliver software to over a billion customers around the world on Apple platforms.

UPDATE
Apple introduces new version of iMovie featuring Storyboards and Magic Movie
iMovie 3.0 makes it easier than ever for anyone to share their stories with video
Apple today introduced a new version ofiMoviewith features that make it easier than ever to create beautiful edited videos on iPhone and iPad. Storyboards helps aspiring content creators and moviemakers learn to edit and improve their video storytelling skills with pre-made templates for popular types of videos shared on social, with colleagues, or with classmates — videos like DIYs, cooking tutorials, product reviews, science experiments, and more. Storyboards makes it easy to get started with flexible shot lists and step-by-step guidance on which clips to capture for each video type. For those who want to create a video even faster, Magic Movie instantly creates a polished video from the clips and photos a user selects, automatically adding transitions, effects, and music to the edit. Both new features include a range of styles to help personalize the final look and feel of a video, including titles, filters, transitions, color palettes, and music, all designed to work together.
“iMovie has empowered millions of people around the world to create and share their stories through video,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “This latest version of iMovie, featuring Storyboards and Magic Movie, simplifies video creation even further, and we think it will continue to inspire the next wave of video creators to dive in and get started.”
Learn and Improve Video Storytelling with Storyboards
Storyboards gives users a major head start in the video creation process, helping beginners learn to edit and improve their storytelling skills. Instead of starting with a blank timeline, creators can choose from 20 different storyboards featuring a variety of popular video types, including cooking tutorials, Q&As, product reviews, news reports, and more. Each storyboard has a shot list that organizes clips to tell a specific narrative. Each placeholder also includes an illustrative thumbnail, along with a tip that asks a question or makes a suggestion for how to shoot that clip to make it more interesting. For added customization, shots can be added, reordered, and deleted from a storyboard as needed.
Creators can experiment by applying different video styles that include titles and transitions, as well as options for title layouts, fonts, filters, and color palettes. Music tracks dynamically adjust to fit the length of a project, and users can refine each clip with intuitive editing tools like trim, split, clip speed, and clip volume.
Completed Storyboard videos are easily shared from iMovie through Messages, Mail, and across social media platforms.
Create Videos Instantly with Magic Movie
Magic Movie helps create beautiful custom videos — complete with titles, transitions, and music — in just a few taps. To create a Magic Movie, a user simply selects an album, or any group of photos or images from their library, and Magic Movie instantly identifies the best parts of the footage and creates the project. Creators can easily put their own spin on a Magic Movie by rearranging or deleting clips in the simplified Magic Movie shot list, or by editing the project further. Styles can be added to change up the look and feel of the entire video. Like Storyboard videos, Magic Movies can be shared from iMovie via Messages, Mail, and on social media.
Availability
iMovie 3.0, including the new Storyboards and Magic Movie features, is available today as a free update on the App Store for devices running iOS 15.2 or later and iPadOS 15.2 or later.

Apple unveils the best photos from the Shot on iPhone Macro Challenge
Winners highlight the global community of iPhone photographers
Over the course of several weeks earlier this year, iPhone photographers from around the world shared their best macro photos for the Shot on iPhone Macro Challenge, making even the smallest details seem epic in images taken with their iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Today, Apple is announcing the 10 winners who highlight the global and diverse community of iPhone photographers, with finalists from China, Hungary, India, Italy, Spain, Thailand, and the US. Their stunning images will be featured on apple.com, on Apple’s Instagram (@apple), and on billboards in select cities.
TheiPhone 13 Pro lineupfeatures the most advanced camera system ever in an iPhone, and for the first time, users can capture sharp, stunning macro images on the device they carry with them wherever they go — opening up a photographic technique previously reserved for those with specialized camera equipment, to even more people. The winning images demonstrate that the beauty of macro photography is its ability to turn the ordinary into the extraordinary, and capture the little things in a big way. Photos include incredible nature shots that might be overlooked by the naked eye, like dewdrops on a spiderweb, snowflakes on a dog’s hair, a cavernous hibiscus flower, and a strawberry engulfed in tiny soda water bubbles.
An international panel of expertjudges— Anand Varma, Apeksha Maker, Peter McKinnon, Paddy Chao, Yik Keat Lee, Arem Duplessis, Billy Sorrentino, Della Huff, Kaiann Drance, and Pamela Chen — selected the winning images and shared some insight on why they love these shots.
Shot on iPhone Macro Challenge — the Winners
“Sea Glass” by Guido CassanelliBuenos Aires, Argentina
From the photographer: “Sea glass is eroded by thousands of miles traveling around the oceans to the shores of the world. I was walking on the beach enjoying a beautiful sunset, and decided to collect some of these small pieces of sea glass to give macro photography on iPhone 13 Pro Max a try. It looks like something strange is happening inside the one placed in the center — it looks like amber. I really love that texture.”
“Photography at its best transports you. Guido Cassanelli’s beautiful image is ethereal, otherworldly, and mysterious. Clearly shot with the iPhone macro lens, but the resulting image has limitless expanse and scale. The psychedelic color range is simply gorgeous.” — Billy Sorrentino
“When we make use of the macro function, the tiny world becomes magnified, and this is a perfect example of that. To be honest, I do not even know what this substance is exactly, but the fact that there is symmetry in the chaos, paired with multiple vibrant colors, makes it super intriguing.” — Yik Keat Lee
“The Cave” by Marco CollettaTaranto, Italy
From the photographer: “The enveloping shape of the petals, accentuated by intense shadows, made me think of a deep cave, ready to be explored; by keeping the point of view inside the flower, I wanted the hibiscus’s natural framing to make us feel fully part of its beauty. When I first learned about macro mode, I thought it was one more cool new feature I was excited to get with my new iPhone 13 Pro. But when I started exploring its possibilities, I really started loving it. I discovered it gives me the possibility to turn nearly everything I see into an abstract subject, different from what it is in reality. This feature really did unlock my imagination.”
“The rich textures and colors of this image make it stand out, and the soft focus of the foreground is a wonderful compositional element that draws the viewer in.” — Della Huff
“Shooting from the side in macro is not an easy task because you have to consider whether the background will clutter the picture. I like the composition of this image with the buds surrounded by the petals, like it’s being held and cherished. The light and shadow bring a sense of serenity.” — Paddy Chao
“Art in Nature” by Prajwal ChouguleKolhapur, Maharashtra, India
From the photographer: “I am a nature lover and love going on early morning walks with my iPhone 13 Pro. The ‘golden hour’ brings the best out of nature and is a photographer’s delight. Dewdrops on a spiderweb caught my attention, and I was fascinated by the way the dry spider silk formed a necklace on which the dew glistened like pearls. It felt like a piece of art on nature’s canvas.”
“A true example of a simple, graphic, yet beautiful image. The water droplets create these gorgeous little pearls that take on the intricate shape of the spiderweb. Simply stunning.” — Arem Duplessis
“This image is so perfect that it looks like an illustration. The well-arranged dewdrops on the spiderweb are captured with great detail. It’s something that most people would miss around them. There is some sort of harmony in the drops; at first glance, the viewer could be deceived on what the subject is. The iPhone does a fantastic job at focusing on such a fine detail, with close to almost no definitive background.” — Apeksha Maker
“A Drop of Freedom” by Daniel OlahBudapest, Hungary
From the photographer: “My intention was to highlight the tiny drop of water in comparison with the lily. I’ve used a spot studio light on the lily with a dark background. I adore the shape of the flower; the lower petal helps keep the focus on the middle part, highlighting not just the drop, but the stamen, too. Nonetheless, the picture has a rhythm that is building toward the euphoria of the composition.”
“This image is reminiscent of a flower painting done by a Dutch master. The background frames the flower beautifully, and allows those gorgeous reds, greens, and blues to come forward against the rich black. The reflecting water droplet at the center could very well be a tear, as this image seduces the viewer’s emotions.” — Arem Duplessis
“I really like how clean this is. The water droplet in the center is an obvious focal point; however, I really like how clean the edges of the plant seem to come out. Very little fringe and artifacting for getting so close. The black background again gives this a very high-end fine art feel, which, let’s be honest, people pay a lot of money for.” — Peter McKinnon
“Leaf Illumination” by Trevor CollinsBoston, USA
From the photographer: “This one instance was during the sliver of golden hour when the sun is shining directly into my window, illuminating all of the tiny cells in each leaf. The leaf depicted is from a fiddle-leaf fig that sits on my desk, where I get to see it all throughout the day.”
“Who knew an ordinary leaf could be so intricate? It’s remarkable how a simple backlight can reveal this hidden world of structure and connection that would otherwise go unnoticed.” — Anand Varma
“The reason I like this so much is the obvious layering. The depth of field created with the iPhone here very clearly shows you what the focal point is, and represents a fantastic example of how good the software is at completely isolating the foreground, leaving the background blurry. A perfect example of computational depth of field.” — Peter McKinnon
“Strawberry in Soda” by Ashley LeeSan Francisco, USA
From the photographer: “Using photography to transform everyday items into something more extraordinary is always a fun puzzle that brings out my creativity. For this photo, I used two items that I found in my kitchen fridge: a strawberry and a can of soda. I placed a clear vase on my kitchen counter, poured the soda into the vase, and used a piece of black paper as the background. I then dropped the strawberry in the vase of soda and waited. Slowly, bubbles began to form on the surface of the strawberry, and its texture was completely transformed. I was amazed by the level of detail I was able to capture by taking a macro photo, as I could see the individual bubbles from the soda that were forming on the strawberry’s surface. I chose a strawberry as the subject because I liked how the bright red popped against the black background. The stark contrast focuses your attention on the strawberry and its bubbles, and makes it seem as if the strawberry is floating in space.”
“This photo takes my breath away at first glance. The clarity with motion and the brightness of the strawberry really come through so delightfully.” — Kaiann Drance
“The photographer found a creative use of macro to celebrate the intricate texture of the humble strawberry. I love the energy of the air bubbles, captured at peak fizziness.” — Pamela Chen
“Volcanic Lava” by Abhik MondalNew Milford, New Jersey, USA
From the photographer: “After buying the new iPhone 13 Pro in December, I was amazed with its macro feature and started capturing different objects, including flowers, insects, plants, and more. One day, during a regular evening walk, I went to a grocery store, where I noticed a bouquet of flowers. This beautiful sunflower caught my attention with its intricate details, including the presence of contrasting colors from the center toward the edge of the petals. I immediately decided to take the bouquet home and capture the beauty of it.”
“Flora and flower photography are the bread and butter of macro photography, and Abhik Mondal’s sunflower is a wonderful showcase of the power of iPhone. The petals lead the viewer toward the kaleidoscopic disk flowers and seeds. Contrast, texture, and smart framing make this a winner.” — Billy Sorrentino
“I feel like the world is my oyster when looking at this photo; the amount of texture in this macro shot is truly stunning, as is using rule of thirds to frame the flower and get the audience to ponder what is beyond the frame. This flower visual draws me in.” — Yik Keat Lee
“Honeycomb” by Tom ReevesNew York City, USA
From the photographer: “This image was taken along the edge of Riverside Park in Manhattan while on a morning walk with our puppy this winter. As she marveled at her first snow, I was able to capture the ephemeral latticework of this tiny snowflake as it landed among the threads of her many honey-colored curls.”
“This image is such a mood. You can practically feel the brisk winter wind that swept these snowflakes here, well seen in their most candid and unmelted beauty. The photographer was able to capture such a delicate detail that tells a larger story, full of movement and life.” — Pamela Chen
“Is this real, or are those small jewels? The snowflakes are elegantly captured with the detail from macro, and the strands of hair look like spun gold.” — Kaiann Drance
“Hidden Gem” by Jirasak PanpiansinChaiyaphum City, Thailand
From the photographer: “This tiny, shimmering liquid jewel is delicately nestled at the base of a leaf after a tropical storm, almost imperceptible to the human eye. However, its true brilliance shines through the lens of iPhone — up close, it sparkles with intense clarity, capturing light from the emerging sun and magnifying the intricate, organic geometry of the leaf’s veins underneath. This is nature encapsulated: a world of beauty and wonder made minuscule.”
“This is such an inviting image. I love the soft textures and rich greens, and the reflection and magnification in the water droplet really draw the viewer in.” — Della Huff
“I love the varied light in this image that illuminates the surface texture of the leaf, while simultaneously revealing its inner structure. For me, a successful photograph is one that encourages your eye to linger and explore. This image accomplishes that beautifully.” — Anand Varma
“The Final Bloom” by HojisanChongqing, China
From the photographer: “The photo was taken when my 3-year-old son discovered the blossom of the tulip at home. I then appreciated the flower with my son and took out my iPhone, trying to capture the moment when the sun kissed the flower, which created a perfect shadow at the petals. As I moved my iPhone closer to the flower, it automatically turned on macro mode, and the details of the petals were brought into the fullest. A few moments later, wind came and blew the petals away. Even though the blossom was short, I still captured the highest moment of a tulip’s life, which is a gift from nature.”
“This photo is nothing short of a painting. What catches my eye instantly is the high dynamic range of the iPhone that smoothly evens the harsh and soft light. There is a beautiful harmony in the petals, making it so abstract. Seen from a distance, one wouldn’t be able to recognize the subject. Hojisan has used exposure settings of the iPhone on a harsh day to balance the background well. What completes the image is the ombré colors and fine lines on the petal so crisply captured.” — Apeksha Maker
“The asymmetrical composition and gestalt of Hojisan’s photograph is beautiful. Purposefully abstract, the negative space is as striking as the colorful textures and form.” — Billy Sorrentino

2022-04-14,Decrease,Apple helps suppliers rapidly accelerate renewable energy use around the world,"Text of this article
April 14, 2022
PRESS RELEASE
Apple helps suppliers rapidly accelerate renewable energy use around the world
More than 200 suppliers committed to using only clean power; will help bring on nearly 16 gigawatts
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced that its suppliers more than doubled their use of clean power over the last year, with over 10 gigawatts operational today out of nearly 16 gigawatts in total commitments in the coming years. In 2021, these renewable projects avoided 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions. The projects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road for one year.
Apple is constantly working with its global supply chain to accelerate and support its transition to clean energy. As of today, 213 of the company’s major manufacturing partners have pledged to power all Apple production with renewable electricity across 25 countries. The dozens of new commitments announced today will accelerate progress toward Apple’s 2030 goal to become carbon neutral across its entire supply chain. Apple has been carbon neutral for its global operations since 2020.
“We are proud that so many of our manufacturing partners have joined our urgent work to address the climate crisis by generating more renewable energy around the world,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Clean energy is good for business and good for the planet. By sharing what we learned in our own transition to renewables, we are helping point the way to a greener future.”
Supplier Commitments and Global Energy Projects
In addition to clean energy commitments made by 213 manufacturing partners, Apple is investing directly in renewable projects around the world, including nearly 500 megawatts of solar and other renewable projects in China and Japan to cover a portion of upstream emissions. To support businesses in their transition to clean power, Apple shares data and offers training materials with market-specific information. These resources have helped spur new clean energy solutions across the globe.
In Europe, 11 new suppliers have made clean energy commitments over the last year, including Infineon, Viscom AG, and Lumileds, bringing the total to 25 European companies. They are deploying a range of clean energy solutions, including Infineon utilizing on-site solar in Germany and Austria, and DSM Engineering Materials supporting a wind project in the Netherlands. Apple has already supported two Danish renewable energy projects, including a large solar park near Thisted and wind farm near Esbjerg, both of which power Apple’s data center in the country. The company is also looking at new steps to address customer product use across the region.
In the US, Apple is investing directly in the 2,300-acre IP Radian Solar project in Brown County, Texas. The project will generate 300 megawatts of electricity once construction is completed later this year. Apple made this investment to help address the electricity customers use to charge their Apple devices, which represents 22 percent of the company’s gross carbon footprint.
Apple’s suppliers with US operations also continue to commit to clean energy, with notable new commitments from DuPont, headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware; and Micron Technology, Inc., headquartered in Boise, Idaho, announced today. Already, Apple suppliers Solvay and Corning are helping to support some of the largest solar farms in North Carolina and South Carolina as part of their commitment to Apple.
In China, 23 new suppliers have joined the program in the last year. Nearly all of Apple’s top suppliers headquartered in China have committed to using clean energy for Apple production, with many building on-site solar, while supporting the country’s transition to renewable power. This includes new commitments from suppliers such as Ruicycle, which will be using clean energy in its closed-loop recycling processes for Apple. In 2018, Apple took an innovative approach to accelerate renewable progress in China with the launch of the China Clean Energy Fund. Through this first-of-its-kind investment fund, Apple and its suppliers have invested together in 465 megawatts of clean energy.
In Japan, new options for clean power are emerging for businesses, as power purchase agreements have become more available. While corporate energy buyers were previously limited to rooftop solar and unbundled certificate options, collaborative advocacy has further opened up the market. Twenty new suppliers have committed to clean energy in Japan in the last year, including Kioxia Corporation and Sharp Corporation. Nitto Denko and many of Apple’s other suppliers have invested in on-site solar, and Keiwa is covering its Apple load with power from a wind project located outside of Tokyo.
In South Korea, LG Display Co. Ltd. and Samsung SDI have committed to clean energy for all Apple production. This addition to the program builds on significant progress over the last year, with a total 13 suppliers committing to bring clean energy online.
In markets where suppliers face particular challenges to accessing cost-effective clean energy, Apple works with partners to break down barriers through innovation and policy engagement.
Community Impact of Clean Power
As Apple continues to accelerate progress toward carbon neutrality across its entire global supply chain, the company is also focused on supporting the communities most impacted by climate change. Through its Power for Impact program, Apple provides under-resourced local communities around the world with access to renewable energy while supporting economic growth and social impact.
Currently, solar projects in Colombia, the Philippines, and South Africa are providing affordable and reliable electricity to communities facing significant energy challenges. Apple continues to expand the program to other parts of the world, including Israel, Nigeria, Thailand, and Vietnam. These projects bring jobs and lead to energy savings that can be reinvested into local communities. Apple retains the environmental attributes of each project, and communities use energy savings to support economic growth, education, health, and other social initiatives.

2022-04-19,Increase,Apple expands the use of recycled materials across its products,"Text of this article
April 19, 2022
UPDATE
Apple expands the use of recycled materials across its products
Company also advances new disassembly technology as part of closed-loop goal
Apple today released new details on the increased use of recycled content across its products. For the first time, the company introduced certified recycled gold, and more than doubled the use of recycled tungsten, rare earth elements, and cobalt. Nearly 20 percent of all material used in Apple products in 2021 was recycled, the highest-ever use of recycled content.
Apple released new details on this progress, its recycling innovation efforts, and clean energy in its2022 Environmental Progress Report.
The company also shared new ways customers can celebrate Earth Day, including supporting World Wildlife Fund by using Apple Pay. With educational resources, curated content, and engaging activities across platforms, Apple customers can take opportunities to appreciate the beauty of nature from wherever they are, learn about key issues like climate change, and support causes and communities working to protect the planet.
“As people around the world join in celebrating Earth Day, we are making real progress in our work to address the climate crisis and to one day make our products without taking anything from the earth,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our rapid pace of innovation is already helping our teams use today’s products to build tomorrow’s, and as our global supply chain transitions to clean power, we are charting a path for other companies to follow.”
More Recycled and Responsibly Sourced Materials Across Apple Products
Apple has pioneered innovations in the recycling and sourcing of materials to spur industrywide change. To help its recycling partners build on this momentum worldwide, Apple today announced its newest recycling innovation, Taz, a machine that uses a groundbreaking approach to improve material recovery from traditional electronics recycling.
In 2021, 59 percent of all the aluminum Apple shipped in its products came from recycled sources, with many products featuring 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure. Apple has also made significant progress toward the company’s goal to eliminate plastics from its packaging by 2025, with plastics accounting for just 4 percent of packaging in 2021. Since 2015, Apple has reduced plastic in its packaging by 75 percent.
Additionally, Apple products in 2021 included:
Recovering more materials for use in future products helps reduce mining. From just one metric ton of iPhone components taken apart by Apple’s recycling robots, recyclers can recover the amount of gold and copper companies would typically extract from 2,000 metric tons of mined rock. Apple is also committed to extending the lifetime of its products through refurbishment. In 2021, Apple sent 12.2 million devices and accessories to new owners for reuse, extending their lifetime and reducing the need for future mining. Ultimately, Apple aims to use only renewable or recyclable materials in its products — a goal announced in 2017 that has charted the company’s pathway on design and material sourcing.
Taz, a machine that uses new shredder-like technology to separate magnets from audio modules and recover more rare earth elements, is the latest in a series of recycling advancements spearheaded by Apple. The company has also further expanded the capabilities of its patented iPhone disassembly robot Daisy to take apart 23 models of iPhone, and has offered to license those patents to other companies and researchers free of charge. An additional robot, Dave, disassembles Taptic Engines, helping to recover valuable rare earth magnets, tungsten, and steel.
2022 Environmental Progress Report
In addition to charting progress in recycling innovation and material stewardship, Apple’s newly released 2022 Environmental Progress Report highlights the company’s significant work to become carbon neutral across its global supply chain and the life cycle of every product, as well as progress reducing waste and promoting the safer use of materials in its products.
In a year when many other companies saw large increases in their footprints and the company’s revenue grew 33 percent, Apple’s net emissions remained flat. Apple has been carbon neutral for its global operations since 2020, and has relied on 100 percent renewable energy to power its offices, stores, and data centers since 2018.
Apple recently announced that its suppliers more than doubled their use of clean power over the last year, with over 10 gigawatts operational out of nearly 16 gigawatts in total commitments in the coming years. As of this month, 213 of the company’s major manufacturing partners have pledged to power all Apple production with renewable electricity across 25 countries. In 2021, these renewable projects avoided 13.9 million metric tons of carbon emissions, the equivalent to removing 3 million cars from the road for one year.

FEATURE
From farm to sea: Conserving mangroves to protect local livelihoods and the planet
Apple’s partnership with the Applied Environmental Research Foundation will promote the protection and conservation of mangroves in Maharashtra, India
Just 60 miles south of the vibrant coastal Indian city of Mumbai in Maharashtra, two distinct worlds emerge. The bustling city — full of skyscrapers, restaurants, hotels, shopping districts, countless tuk-tuks, and modern cars — falls away as unpaved roads, palm trees, goats, cows pulling carts, and small open-air markets and restaurants come into view.
In the Raigad district, Alibaug connects Mumbai to a network of rivers branching off of the Arabian Sea. The coastal area is home to 21,000 hectares of mangrove forests, one of Earth’s most natural protectors against the impacts of climate change, which include unpredictable monsoons, rising tides, cyclones — or hurricanes — and even tsunamis, while also acting as carbon sinks that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in their soil, plants, and other sediment, known as blue carbon.
Applied Environmental Research Foundation (AERF) — awarded a grant by Apple in 2021 — is exploring the area with a plan to safeguard the future of these mangroves by creating alternative, sustainable industries in the local communities that cultivate and benefit from the biodiversity and resilience of the mangrove ecosystems. Conservation agreements will provide sustained support to village members in exchange for conserving the land and transitioning the local economy to one that relies on keeping the mangroves intact and healthy.
AERF will also apply learnings from Conservation International’s pilot blue carbon project in Cispatá, Colombia, launched in 2018.
“The fight against climate change is a fight for the communities around the world whose lives and livelihoods are most threatened by the crisis, and that’s where we’ve focused our work — from Colombia to Kenya to the Philippines,” says Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our new partnership in India continues this momentum, helping a community benefit economically from the restoration of the mangrove forests that protect against the worst impacts of climate change.”
Archana Godbole, director of AERF, has loved nature since her childhood. “Plants are a representation of age and time,” she says. “And trees represent patience. They are silent spectators of time — the more I studied them and understood them, the more they humbled me. My experiences instilled in me that I want to work for conservation and save trees and forests.”
Godbole, a trained plant taxonomist, has specialized in community-based conservation for the last 30 years. In Raigad, AERF is pursuing conservation agreements with communities that have lost their crops and fertile agricultural fields due to saltwater intrusion and the destruction of human-made dykes.
“People here and their forefathers were farmers, and suddenly the ocean came to their doorstep,” Godbole says. “But people learned new skills and coped with their new situation. Now that we all know mangroves are important for climate change and sequestering carbon, we’re very happy to have reached this place and are trying to collaborate with the people here to see how mangroves will bring more benefits to them. We’re hopeful that deep connection with the land and mangroves will be established in their minds.”
Below are the faces of these villages, and a glimpse of resilience in the face of increasing climate calamities in the communities many call home.
Karanjveera is a small inland village home to many farmers and fishermen — whose catch typically includes crabs and small shrimp — and their families. Namdev Waitaram More is a village elder and expert on traditional fishing methods. At 75 years old, he has lived peacefully alongside mangroves his entire life, and respects their protective qualities that have kept salt water from entering their paddy fields.
More and his cousin are now helping connect other community members with AERF to discuss salt marsh and mangrove conservation in the village. “Mangroves act like a sponge,” he says. “The people are connected with the mangroves here. If they are gone, our dykes will go, and our paddy fields will also go. Because we’re connected through our food, our dykes, and our mangroves, we are surviving.”
Usha and her son, Tushar Thakur, are farmers from Hashiware, a village along the Amba river whose agricultural land has been submerged in salt water since the local dyke broke in 1990. The land is now its own mangrove forest, but remnants of the past sprinkle the area, as abandoned homes spring out of the muddy waters a few meters from the river’s bank. Thakur was one of the first village members to sign a conservation agreement with AERF to protect the mangroves.
Since 1996, mangroves have covered the agricultural land that once belonged to farmers in Hashiware.
”With our work and awareness around the importance of mangroves,” AERF’s Godbole explains, “and opportunities to create sustainable income-generating activities, we’ve provided hope to the coastal communities in Raigad.”
The power of mangroves to protect India’s coastal villages has been recently demonstrated. After a massive undersea earthquake in Indonesia triggered a series of tsunamis that impacted India’s east coast in 2004, people realized mangroves were the communities’ silent guardians, absorbing the shock of the immense waves and protecting the villages that lay beyond. Over the last few years, the region has seen more-frequent strong cyclones, including Nisarga in 2020 and Tauktae in 2021. In Raigad, families in the villages are working to protect the mangroves and, in turn, their own well-being and livelihoods.
In the village of Ganesh Patti, farmers agreed to maintain their respective portions of the dyke that separate agricultural land from mangroves and the banks of the river. But individual maintenance was not enough. According to local fisherman Mangesh Patil, whose home now stands hollow and surrounded by mangroves, strong waves and increasingly high tides led to its gradual destruction.
But for everyone in the vanished village, it seemed to happen overnight.
“While we were sleeping,” Patil says, “there was a high tide happening, and suddenly the water came in and our mattresses got drenched with water. In the morning, we realized the entire village had been submerged.”
As the water receded, families registered the loss of their land and livelihood — they knew they’d have to start from scratch. After relocating to a nearby village, many people, including Patil and his brother, decided to continue visiting their old homes, returning to their local Hindu temple, and fishing and crab hunting in the waters of their childhood.
“Man should learn to survive in whatever situation nature has given him,” Patil says. “That is what we’ve been doing, and now there is a linkage between us and these mangroves. This is our birthplace — we were happy here. So we’ll keep coming here.”
In addition to funding conservation agreements with the local villages, Apple’s grant is supporting the purchase and distribution of portable bio-stoves that allow people to cook without cutting down mangroves for firewood.
Bhavik Patil, a local fisherman and expert in mangrove-based livelihood activity from Pen Vashi, has helped AERF navigate discussions in villages throughout Raigad. Born into a family of fishermen, Patil recalls his childhood, when his parents would tie a swing to the mangrove trees for him and his brothers to play on when they went out into the river. Today, in addition to fishing and crab hunting, he is one of many negotiating with members of their villages — including Mothe Bhal and Vithalwadi — to conserve and sustainably use the mangroves. To aid in conservation, he and his counterparts ask them to collect dried branches that have already fallen off the trees.
For the members of AERF, protecting mangroves is more than a job — it is their passion. Godbole and co-founder Jayant Sarnaik launched the organization 27 years ago, and they have continued their mission to achieve conservation through people’s participation on the ground.
“Building resilience against climate change is a continuous process for the communities living in proximity to the sea,” says AERF’s Sarnaik. “Since these communities have been living on the coast for a very long time, they understand the ocean and its relationship with climate very well. Climate change for them is not a new phenomenon; however, they have experienced drastic changes over the last five to 10 years. The recent cyclones have sensitized these people about the importance of mangroves as the most robust natural defense against such calamities. It also awakened interest in the conscience of the broader community about mangroves.”
As Godbole describes, the future looks promising. “To collaborate with Apple and Conservation International is a great opportunity to explore how mangrove conservation and community benefits can go hand in hand,” she says. “Though mangrove conservation issues are diverse and different in each place, here in our project area, opportunities are also many. Training our young, enthusiastic team as well as local communities for blue carbon will surely help us travel a long way to achieve mangrove conservation in this vibrant coastal area along the Arabian Sea.”
Apple is committed to efforts around the world that provide climate resilience and economic benefit to communities most impacted by climate change. In the last year, the company supported a first-of-its-kind Irrecoverable Carbon Finance Lab with Conservation International to protect some of the world’s most delicate ecosystems, and has provided funding for research and pilots to increase nature-based carbon sinks in China with the China Green Carbon Foundation. And in addition to making a donation to World Wildlife Fund for every Apple Pay purchase of Apple products at an Apple Store, in the Apple Store app, or on apple.com during Earth Week, Apple is also supporting WWF’s Climate Crowd program focused on community climate resilience and promoting sustainable livelihoods.

April 27, 2022
PRESS RELEASE
Apple’s Self Service Repair now available
Genuine Apple parts and tools can now be purchased by US customers
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaApple today announced Self Service Repair is now available, providing repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools through the AppleSelf Service Repair Store. Self Service Repair is available in the US and will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — later this year.
The new online store offers more than 200 individual parts and tools, enabling customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices to complete repairs on the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups and iPhone SE (3rd generation), such as the display, battery, and camera. Later this year the program will also include manuals, parts, and tools to perform repairs on Mac computers with Apple silicon.
To start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visitingsupport.apple.com/self-service-repair. Then, they can visit the Apple Self Service Repair Store and order the necessary parts and tools.
Every genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. The parts are the same ones — at the same price — as those available to Apple’s network of authorized repair providers. For certain repairs, customers will receive a credit when returning a replaced part for recycling.
The Apple tools available to customers on the Self Service Repair Store are the same as used by Apple’s repair network. They are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. The high-quality tools offered through Self Service Repair include torque drivers, repair trays, display and battery presses, and more.
Apple will offer tool rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. The weeklong rental kits will ship to customers for free.
Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.
Over the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 3,000 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, in the US, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 20 minutes of an authorized service provider.
Also today, Apple published a paper, “Expanding Access to Safe, Reliable, and Secure Service and Repair,” which details Apple’s approach to designing long-lasting products and increasing access to repairs.

If you bring all the recordings back to the studio, you don’t know if you’ve missed the moment.

Uncovering the sounds of a galaxy far, far away with Mac
Skywalker Sound artists share their creative process, the origins of R2-D2’s voice, and their journey to building a vast sound library
In the rugged terrain of Nicasio, California, population shy of one thousand, visitors to this isolated corner of Marin County are surrounded by a spirit of limitless possibility. Miles of concealed cables and gadgetry teem underfoot.
This is the site of Skywalker Ranch, the vast facility owned and conceived by George Lucas, the creator of the epic Star Wars universe. The cornerstone of the ranch is Skywalker Sound, a world-class sound design, editing, mixing, and audio post-production facility. The 153,000-square-foot, red-bricked building, surrounded by vineyards and the man-made Lake Ewok, stands as a monument to the maxim, often repeated by Lucas, that sound is at least 50 percent of the moviegoing experience.
The sound library system Soundminer, which allows for descriptive keyword searches almost poetic in their specificity, keeps pace with Skywalker Sound’s ever-expanding library of nearly a million sounds.
With the power of approximately 130 Mac Pro racks, as well as 50 iMac, 50 MacBook Pro, and 50 Mac mini computers running Pro Tools as their main audio application, along with a fleet of iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV devices, Skywalker is advancing sound artistry and reshaping the industry.
“I started out with a Macintosh SE, way back,” says Ben Burtt, the legendary sound designer of the original “Star Wars” films, the prequels, and the “Indiana Jones” franchise. “Word processing was a huge leap forward for me as a writer.”
“Sound editing in a way is really the same as word processing; cutting and pasting files,” Burtt continues. “All the experience I had on the Mac immediately gave me training for what came along in cutting digital sound. I started cutting using a Mac with Final Cut in the late ‘90s, and now have four Mac computers. Each handles a different process: one for picture editing, sound editing, manuscript writing, I’m completely surrounded. They’re labeled Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta.”
Talk to any artist at Skywalker Sound and it quickly becomes evident they all harbor a personal library of treasured recordings. “Sounds that evoke emotion are what we’re always on a quest for,” supervising sound editor and sound designer Al Nelson says.
For sound designers, even outdated equipment creates opportunity. “I love happy accidents and I love breaking technology and getting unexpected results,” says Nelson. “I love to play with digital systems that are clocking wrong, meaning the way the bits are flowing. It’s broken, it sounds like bad radio. I have a really old PowerBook, and it has certain old software I like to use; I can feed recordings into it and digitally break them.”
One never knows when inspiration will strike. A contractor who knew Burtt was always on the lookout for unique sounds once called to say he’d heard a strange, broken ceiling fan in an apartment he was servicing. Burtt’s recording of the wobbly blades later transformed into the ominous sound of the laser gates that momentarily divide Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul during the climactic lightsaber duel in “Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace.”
Sources sometimes materialize from thin air. “I’ve had people write me on the internet and say, ‘My aunt has a really weird cough, do you want to record it for a creature?’” Burtt says. (Nelson refers to these components as “creature sweeteners.”)
When gathering field recordings in nature, supervising sound editor Baihui Yang stresses the handiness of having a MacBook Pro on-site. “We can bring the Pro Tools session with us in the field and watch and record and quickly put it together, to test whether it works or not,” she says. “If you bring all the recordings back to the studio, you don’t know if you’ve missed the moment.” Applications like Keyboard Maestro are also integral to her process, as is Matchbox software.
With a background in classical guitar, among other instruments, Nelson often seeks musicality in the outside world, as well as inside the mixing room. “We’re all musicians — either literally musicians, or musicians of sound,” he says. “Everything is very much a tonal approach or an orchestration approach. You can’t just throw noise at the screen; you have to articulate and pick your flavors in the same way that you would orchestrate something symphonic.”
The sounds we associate with Apple — the iconic F-sharp startup chime of a Mac, the swoosh of an outgoing email — share an essential, underlying characteristic with many of the most recognizable sounds of Star Wars, and that is one of activation. Think how often an idle droid bursts to life with warnings and bleeps. Or how the elegant, dormant handle of a lightsaber suddenly pierces into a glow. Or a ship, sputtering and lumbering through space, thrusts into lightspeed.
“What I learned from Star Wars was that Ben used all natural sounds to do science fiction,” says Gary Rydstrom, a seven-time Oscar-winning sound designer who started working at Lucasfilm in 1983. “He kept sounds in the Star Wars universe gritty and realistic, based on real sounds you would manipulate into something you’d never heard before, which was inspiring.”
A key distinction in Burtt’s work is the element of performance. “When it comes to fantasy sounds, especially — alien voices, creatures, weapons, strange things of the sort — a performance helps,” Burtt says. In the earliest stages of finding the voice of R2-D2, which set the standard for how sound design can influence character development, Burtt felt increased pressure, knowing the droid would be sharing scenes with Alec Guinness.
“When I sat down and started experimenting with R2 on the first film, suddenly I realized that I’m in dialogue,” Burtt explains. “The timing is very important. Once we realized we had something that was working, the picture editors went back through the movie and started re-cutting many of the scenes, changing the timing ever so slightly. It began to figure into the actual pacing, as any dialogue would.” Burtt continued to refine the performance in the prequels, for which he served as both sound designer and picture editor.
As the artists at Skywalker Sound have settled into the digital age of filmmaking, their advice for both aspiring and professional filmmakers is boundless. “I tell young people who want to work with sound in movies, ‘You should listen to the world around you and build a sound effects collection,’” Burtt says. “Get a recording and classify it, because any time you build a library of sound, you are making creative choices. The other thing is that because there are plenty of inexpensive applications that you can have access to now on your iPad or your MacBook, that you can actually do all kinds of cutting and sound-mixing at home. I could never do that. If I was a teenage filmmaker again, I’d be amazed. I’d have drones, I could do all kinds of sound recording. I could do none of those things in my formative years.”
Nelson even attests that iPhone recordings are “perfectly useable” in a professional context.
“However you do it,” Rydstrom says, “think about sound early on, because it’s one of your storytelling tools. I will argue it’s one of the more efficient storytelling tools, once you get into the shooting and cutting.”
“You can tell a lot of the story with sound in a way that is less expensive than visuals, usually, and sometimes more emotionally powerful,” Rydstrom continues. “If you’re interested in sound or filmmaking, you can record 4K+ video on your iPhone. There’s no excuse. The stuff that’s part of our day-to-day lives is the same stuff you need to record sound and make movies. That’s the real revolution. Ultimately, it will democratize the whole process.”
On Monday, May 9, 2022, fans can join sound designer Leff Lefferts as he shares his favorite projects and how Skywalker Sound brings iconic movie characters to life with Apple Music’s Eddie Francis. Participants will view footage from Skywalker Ranch in Apple’s Behind the Mac film, and learn from an Apple Creative Pro how to make vocal effects for a character using their voice, everyday objects, and GarageBand on Mac.

May 5, 2022
PRESS RELEASE
Apple, Google, and Microsoft commit to expanded support for FIDO standard to accelerate availability of passwordless sign‑ins
Faster, easier, and more secure sign‑ins will be available to consumers across leading devices and platforms
Mountain View, CaliforniaIn a joint effort to make the web more secure and usable for all, Apple, Google, and Microsoft today announced plans to expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium. The new capability will allow websites and apps to offer consistent, secure, and easy passwordless sign-ins to consumers across devices and platforms.
Password-only authentication is one of the biggest security problems on the web, and managing so many passwords is cumbersome for consumers, which often leads consumers to reuse the same ones across services. This practice can lead to costly account takeovers, data breaches, and even stolen identities. While password managers and legacy forms of two-factor authentication offer incremental improvements, there has been industry-wide collaboration to create sign-in technology that is more convenient and more secure.
The expanded standards-based capabilities will give websites and apps the ability to offer an end-to-end passwordless option. Users will sign in through the same action that they take multiple times each day to unlock their devices, such as a simple verification of their fingerprint or face, or a device PIN. This new approach protects against phishing and sign-in will be radically more secure when compared to passwords and legacy multi-factor technologies such as one-time passcodes sent over SMS.
An Expansion of Passwordless Standard Support
Hundreds of technology companies and service providers from around the world worked within the FIDO Alliance and W3C to create the passwordless sign-in standards that are already supported in billions of devices and all modern web browsers. Apple, Google, and Microsoft have led development of this expanded set of capabilities and are now building support into their respective platforms.
These companies’ platforms already support FIDO Alliance standards to enable passwordless sign-in on billions of industry-leading devices, but previous implementations require users to sign in to each website or app with each device before they can use passwordless functionality. Today’s announcement extends these platform implementations to give users two new capabilities for more seamless and secure passwordless sign-ins:
In addition to facilitating a better user experience, the broad support of this standards-based approach will enable service providers to offer FIDO credentials without needing passwords as an alternative sign-in or account recovery method.
These new capabilities are expected to become available across Apple, Google, and Microsoft platforms over the course of the coming year.
“‘Simpler, stronger authentication’ is not just FIDO Alliance’s tagline — it also has been a guiding principle for our specifications and deployment guidelines. Ubiquity and usability are critical to seeing multi-factor authentication adopted at scale, and we applaud Apple, Google, and Microsoft for helping make this objective a reality by committing to support this user-friendly innovation in their platforms and products,” said Andrew Shikiar, executive director and CMO of the FIDO Alliance. “This new capability stands to usher in a new wave of low-friction FIDO implementations alongside the ongoing and growing utilization of security keys — giving service providers a full range of options for deploying modern, phishing-resistant authentication.”
“The standards developed by the FIDO Alliance and World Wide Web Consortium and being led in practice by these innovative companies is the type of forward-leaning thinking that will ultimately keep the American people safer online. I applaud the commitment of our private sector partners to open standards that add flexibility for the service providers and a better user experience for customers,” said Jen Easterly, Director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. “At CISA, we are working to raise the cybersecurity baseline for all Americans. Today is an important milestone in the security journey to encourage built-in security best practices and help us move beyond passwords. Cyber is a team sport, and we’re pleased to continue our collaboration.”
“Just as we design our products to be intuitive and capable, we also design them to be private and secure,” said Kurt Knight, Apple’s Senior Director of Platform Product Marketing. “Working with the industry to establish new, more secure sign-in methods that offer better protection and eliminate the vulnerabilities of passwords is central to our commitment to building products that offer maximum security and a transparent user experience — all with the goal of keeping users’ personal information safe.”
“This milestone is a testament to the collaborative work being done across the industry to increase protection and eliminate outdated password-based authentication,” said Mark Risher, Senior Director of Product Management, Google. “For Google, it represents nearly a decade of work we’ve done alongside FIDO, as part of our continued innovation towards a passwordless future. We look forward to making FIDO-based technology available across Chrome, ChromeOS, Android and other platforms, and encourage app and website developers to adopt it, so people around the world can safely move away from the risk and hassle of passwords.”
“The complete shift to a passwordless world will begin with consumers making it a natural part of their lives. Any viable solution must be safer, easier, and faster than the passwords and legacy multi-factor authentication methods used today,” says Alex Simons, Corporate Vice President, Identity Program Management at Microsoft. “By working together as a community across platforms, we can at last achieve this vision and make significant progress toward eliminating passwords. We see a bright future for FIDO-based credentials in both consumer and enterprise scenarios and will continue to build support across Microsoft apps and services.”

Three AAPI founders building apps on the App Store that cultivate community
Founders of Coffee Meets Bagel, HmongPhrases, and Weee! reflect on how their personal experiences shaped the vision for their apps, and look ahead to the next generation of app creators
Many of today’s most impactful creators are combining the power of technology with their personal experiences to offer valuable spaces for users to learn, share, and connect on the App Store.
When Larry Liu first immigrated to the U.S., he realized there wasn’t an easy way for the Asian community to buy the goods needed to make some of their favorite dishes. Wanting to provide a place to celebrate and bring widespread access to Asian and Hispanic food, he turned to the App Store to launch grocery delivery app Weee! People would no longer have to be limited to the small “ethnic” aisle at mainstream grocery stores.
As big advocates for human connection, Dawoon Kang and her twin sister Arum teamed up to found Coffee Meets Bagel, a dating app with an intentionally “slower” approach. Their algorithm focuses not on getting users the most likes, but on guiding them toward meaningful conversations. As one of the most popular dating apps, Coffee Meets Bagel has facilitated over 150 million matches to date.
Annie Vang, a participant of Apple Entrepreneur Camp in 2021, created HmongPhrases to help preserve the Hmong dialect for future generations. Though the Hmong population has been in the U.S. for over 40 years, it is widely considered one of the most marginalized Asian groups. Her app allows users to search for a phrase in Hmong, hear what it sounds like, and then practice saying it out loud. As a true labor of love, not only does Annie do the coding for the app herself — she even records the phrases in her own voice.
Liu, Kang, and Vang discuss how they used technology to transform their ideas into powerful platforms, how their apps uplift their communities, and how they influence positive change.
Why do you feel like the world needed your app?
Annie Vang (founder, HmongPhrases):When Apple said, “There’s an app for that,” I knew I had to make one for the Hmong people. I wanted us to have a presence on the world’s stage. So I bought an iPhone and took a course. That was a monumental moment for me because I was building an app and doing something no one else was doing — documenting my language using Apple’s platform. Building HmongPhrases is a celebration of my Hmong identity. We are on the cusp of losing our spoken language in future generations, and I hope that my app will be helpful to all those wanting to learn the Hmong dialect.
Dawoon Kang (co-founder and Chief Dating Officer, Coffee Meets Bagel):Love is the reason why we are here, and love with our romantic partner is one of the most important loves of all. We saw a need for a dating app that’s not just about casual dates but about giving everyone a chance at love.
How does your app support and uplift your community?
AV:Not many people know who the Hmong people are because we don’t have a country of our own. My vision for HmongPhrases is to serve as a digital footprint to preserve the language for future generations and anyone who wants to learn Hmong. I also hope that the app can help bridge the language gap.
Larry Liu (founder and CEO, Weee!):Food brings people together. It’s about shared culture, community, and identity, and a celebration of life. Changing grocery shopping from a rote chore into something fun and shareable is a crucial part of Weee!. Consumers are rewarded for sharing their thoughts and recommendations with the community of shoppers. Weee! also creates a feeling of being at home and being seen, particularly for immigrants, but also for second- and third-generation consumers who can access ingredients to make their mom’s congee, or whatever their favorite comfort food or snack is.
What are some challenges you face as a creator and entrepreneur? How have you overcome these challenges?
LL:It was a huge challenge to gain support and raise funds in the early days of Weee!. Some folks have never even stepped foot inside of an Asian or Hispanic grocery store, and have a hard time grasping the idea that food could be a source of comfort, nostalgia, and familial connection. I had to provide deeper context into why food can be so meaningful.
AV:It’s been hard not seeing very many Asian American women in the digital app space. At times, I feel like I’ve had to work twice as hard to prove my worth. I’ve had to step outside my comfort zone to show people what I can create outside of the social norms of being an Asian woman, and I am learning that I am as valuable as anyone.
How have your experiences influenced how you’ve created your app and how you run your business?
LL:When I immigrated to the U.S. and couldn’t find the foods I missed from China, I went on a chat app to network with neighbors and to try to source some of these items. I saw the impact of fostering a community and how excited people were to connect about food and recipes. This influenced how we designed Weee! as a social commerce platform. I also wanted Weee! to be inclusive and accessible for all ages, generations, and across languages, so that everyone can benefit from what our app provides.
DK:I knew from the very beginning that dating is a cultural phenomenon, and it was important to have diverse representation in our workforce and our dater research. I can empathize with others thanks to my upbringing as a minority, but my perspective is also limited to my own experiences. I knew I needed people of different backgrounds who can serve different types of daters better. Ultimately, we want to get to a point where dating becomes so personalized that we don’t have to make general assumptions about a dater based on their identity group. But we are not there yet.
AV:When I was young, I was ashamed of being Asian. I wasn’t born in the U.S.; I was born in a refugee camp. As a foreigner, I tried to assimilate, but all at the cost of losing my native tongue. I did not have a lot of role models that looked like me, and it wasn’t until I was in my 20s that I fully embraced being an Hmong American. I wanted to be proud of my heritage and culture. I love our food, language, and cultures, and this growing love has helped me strive to build tools to bring us closer together as a community.
What feedback have you received from users?
DK:The AAPI community makes up over 45 percent of Coffee Meets Bagel’s user base, which is huge! They send 1.6x more chat messages per day and 1.3x more chat messages per connection than any other community of daters in the U.S. When we ask Asian American daters what they like about Coffee Meets Bagel, they always mention how much they value the quality of the people on the platform and the focus on long-term relationships.
LL:It’s most gratifying to hear from customers across the country, whether they’re in an ethnic food desert in the Midwest or in a metropolitan city with limited access to ethnic grocery stores. We’ve made efforts to source an array of products that some customers haven’t been able to enjoy in the States for years or even decades, and our customers resonate with the belief that food is meant to be shared and explored together.
AV:Many HmongPhrases users like how the app represents both dialects for Green Hmong and White Hmong speakers. Many have told me that with the help of my app, they were able to learn phrases to speak to their grandparents and family members. When people learn that I am a one-woman show and the sole developer, designer, sound editor, and creator of my app, they tell me they feel inspired, and I hope I can encourage young aspiring creators to pursue paths in technology.
What advice do you have for those who are looking to found their own company or create their own app?
AV:Find your spark. Even if no one believes in you, you must believe in yourself. Write down your vision and how you plan to achieve it. Seek supportive advocates and mentors who can help inspire you, keep you motivated, and help you reach your goal.
LL:Try to solve a problem that is important to you. Find out if the problem and solution relates to big shifts in society. Then seek how you are uniquely positioned to solve it.
DK:Know that starting a company is fundamentally different from starting another job. Make sure it’s a mission you feel is worth dedicating over 10 years of your life to! Yes, you might not work on it for 10 years, but you just might.
What do you hope for the next generation of AAPI founders, entrepreneurs, and creators?
LL:I hope we can leverage our understanding of diverse cultures. In a world that is fast globalizing, that can be a huge asset.
AV:I hope that we can continue supporting and uplifting each other. I feel so inspired when others share their story, even if we are all on different journeys and come from different places.
DK:Celebrate and be proud of the unique perspective our heritage and experiences have gifted us with. When there are negative stories about our communities, we have the power to try and change that narrative.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple previews innovative accessibility features combining the power of hardware, software, and machine learning
Software features coming later this year offer users with disabilities new tools for navigation, health, communication, and more
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewed innovative software features that introduce new ways for users with disabilities to navigate, connect, and get the most out of Apple products. These powerful updates combine the company’s latest technologies to deliver unique and customizable tools for users, and build on Apple’s long-standing commitment to making products that work for everyone.
Using advancements across hardware, software, and machine learning, people who are blind or low vision can use their iPhone and iPad to navigate the last few feet to their destination with Door Detection; users with physical and motor disabilities who may rely on assistive features like Voice Control and Switch Control can fully control Apple Watch from their iPhone with Apple Watch Mirroring; and the Deaf and hard of hearing community can follow Live Captions on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple is also expanding support for its industry-leading screen reader VoiceOver with over 20 new languages and locales. These features will be available later this year with software updates across Apple platforms.
“Apple embeds accessibility into every aspect of our work, and we are committed to designing the best products and services for everyone,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “We’re excited to introduce these new features, which combine innovation and creativity from teams across Apple to give users more options to use our products in ways that best suit their needs and lives.”
Door Detection for Users Who Are Blind or Low Vision
Apple is introducing Door Detection, a cutting-edge navigation feature for users who are blind or low vision. Door Detection can help users locate a door upon arriving at a new destination, understand how far they are from it, and describe door attributes — including if it is open or closed, and when it’s closed, whether it can be opened by pushing, turning a knob, or pulling a handle. Door Detection can also read signs and symbols around the door, like the room number at an office, or the presence of an accessible entrance symbol. This new feature combines the power of LiDAR, camera, and on-device machine learning, and will be available on iPhone and iPad models with the LiDAR Scanner.1
Door Detection will be available in a new Detection Mode within Magnifier, Apple’s built-in app supporting blind and low vision users. Door Detection, along with People Detection and Image Descriptions, can each be used alone or simultaneously in Detection Mode, offering users with vision disabilities a go-to place with customizable tools to help navigate and access rich descriptions of their surroundings. In addition to navigation tools within Magnifier, Apple Maps will offer sound and haptics feedback for VoiceOver users to identify the starting point for walking directions.
Advancing Physical and Motor Accessibility for Apple Watch
Apple Watch becomes more accessible than ever for people with physical and motor disabilities with Apple Watch Mirroring, which helps users control Apple Watch remotely from their paired iPhone. With Apple Watch Mirroring, users can control Apple Watch using iPhone’s assistive features like Voice Control and Switch Control, and use inputs including voice commands, sound actions, head tracking, or external Made for iPhone switches as alternatives to tapping the Apple Watch display. Apple Watch Mirroring uses hardware and software integration, including advances built on AirPlay, to help ensure users who rely on these mobility features can benefit from unique Apple Watch apps like Blood Oxygen, Heart Rate, Mindfulness, and more.2
Plus, users can do even more with simple hand gestures to control Apple Watch. With new Quick Actions on Apple Watch, a double-pinch gesture can answer or end a phone call, dismiss a notification, take a photo, play or pause media in the Now Playing app, and start, pause, or resume a workout. This builds on the innovative technology used in AssistiveTouch on Apple Watch, which gives users with upper body limb differences the option to control Apple Watch with gestures like a pinch or a clench without having to tap the display.
Live Captions Come to iPhone, iPad, and Mac for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Users
For the Deaf and hard of hearing community, Apple is introducing Live Captions on iPhone, iPad, and Mac.3Users can follow along more easily with any audio content — whether they are on a phone or FaceTime call, using a video conferencing or social media app, streaming media content, or having a conversation with someone next to them. Users can also adjust font size for ease of reading. Live Captions in FaceTime attribute auto-transcribed dialogue to call participants, so group video calls become even more convenient for users with hearing disabilities. When Live Captions are used for calls on Mac, users have the option to type a response and have it spoken aloud in real time to others who are part of the conversation. And because Live Captions are generated on device, user information stays private and secure.
VoiceOver Adds New Languages and More
VoiceOver, Apple’s industry-leading screen reader for blind and low vision users, is adding support for more than 20 additional locales and languages, including Bengali, Bulgarian, Catalan, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.4Users can also select from dozens of new voices that are optimized for assistive features across languages. These new languages, locales, and voices will also be available for Speak Selection and Speak Screen accessibility features. Additionally, VoiceOver users on Mac can use the new Text Checker tool to discover common formatting issues such as duplicative spaces or misplaced capital letters, which makes proofreading documents or emails even easier.

2022-05-18,Decrease,Apple introduces new professional training to support growing IT workforce,"Text of this article
May 18, 2022
UPDATE
Apple introduces new professional training to support growing IT workforce
New online courses and certifications for Apple device support, deployment, and management prepare workers for in-demand careers
Demand for skilled support and technical staff within the enterprise is growing, with jobs in computer and information systems in particular projected to grow faster than the average for all occupations from 2020 to 2030.1As companies expand their use of technology, employees are demanding to use iPhone, iPad, and Mac at work, resulting in an increased need for IT professionals skilled in supporting and managing Apple products.
To help meet this growing demand, Apple today launched updated professional training and certifications for IT support and management. The training has been completely redesigned and moved to an online, self-paced format. Users can demonstrate their competency with two new exams and earn certification from Apple.
“More people than ever are using Mac, iPad, and iPhone to do their best work, and the demand for Apple-certified IT professionals has never been greater,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Enterprise and Education Marketing. “Apple Professional Training helps anyone with an interest in technology — whether they are changing careers or upping their skill set — pursue high-paying IT jobs with certifications that will stand out to potential employers. We believe deeply in inclusion in technology, so the new courses are self-paced and freely available, and we are working to ensure ability to pay isn’t a barrier to earning Apple certification.”
Two new Apple Professional Training courses — Apple Device Support, and Apple Deployment and Management — are available today ontraining.apple.com. The courses are sequential, and build on skills and concepts as the user progresses. At the completion of each course, new certification exams are available to demonstrate competence achieved at each level with corresponding digital badges from Apple. Each exam costs $149, and certification can be displayed on resumes, online profiles, and job boards, enabling users to stand out in job searches — and employers to find qualified candidates.2
Apple device management and security company Jamf reported that itscommunityof professionals who manage Apple products at work has grown by more than 150 percent since 2017 to more than 100k members.3And companies like Ford are seeking to hire talent to manage their Apple products.
“Transforming Ford and delivering great value to our customers is being fueled by technology — including enabling our people to do their best work with the best tools as we create the digital factory of the future,” said Mike Amend, Ford’s chief enterprise technology officer. “As part of that process, we’re rolling out Mac as a choice for our employees. Apple’s new professional training certifications will help us attract highly talented IT people and see that they’re successful carrying out our Ford+ growth plan.”
Apple’s new IT training series begins with the Apple Device Support course. Through articles and guided exercises, the course covers the tools, services, and best practices used by a help desk professional, technical coordinator, or service provider for an organization’s Mac, iPhone, and iPad users. After completing an estimated 14 hours of learning content, users can take an exam to earn the Apple Certified Support Professional certification.
The second level of training in the IT series is the Apple Deployment and Management course, which covers how to configure, manage, and secure Apple products using mobile device management (MDM). Through an estimated 13 hours of content, users will cover developing a deployment strategy, using Apple Business Manager and Apple School Manager, and configuring devices with an MDM solution. Upon successful completion of the exam, users will receive the Apple Certified IT Professional certification.4
To help those entering the workforce or changing careers, Apple is partnering with community colleges and universities to offer on-campus prep courses for the Apple Certified IT Professional badge. Through its Community Education Initiative (CEI), Apple will provide scholarships to cover the cost of the exams for participating students at its CEI partner institutions. Apple first worked with Austin Community College in Austin, Texas, to offer the Apple deployment course in early 2020, and is expanding to Maricopa Community Colleges in Chandler and Mesa, Arizona, this summer, with additional CEI schools to be announced. Ed Farm, an education nonprofit based in Birmingham, Alabama, will also offer prep courses for Apple’s certification exams this summer through the nonprofit’s ongoing partnership with Apple.
Apple has also partnered with the Mac Admins Foundation to ensure additional access to the new Apple exams. With underwriting from Apple, the foundation will offer vouchers to applicants with financial need. As a new 501(c)(3) organization, two key tenets of the Mac Admins Foundation are making a welcoming and accessible organization to expand the profession, and maintaining affordable access to all community resources. For more details and to apply, visitmacadmins.org.
“There’s a lot to like about the all-new Apple Professional Training courses, which give users a solid grounding in the concepts and theory around supporting and deploying Apple products,” said Tom Bridge, the Mac Admins Foundation’s co-chair. “Furthermore, both Apple exams are fully representative of the depth and breadth of skills needed for success. This is an important milestone for the Mac Admins community — which has grown 48 percent since 2019. We’re excited to work with Apple in our new chapter as a 501(c)(3) and ensure that the certification is available to anyone with the passion to take a new step forward in their career.”
Apple Professional Training courses are available now attraining.apple.com.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple unveils new Apple Watch Pride Edition bands
A new Shot on iPhone pride campaign will launch in June
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAIn celebration of Pride month this June, Apple is releasing two new Pride Edition bands with dynamic Pride watch faces in support of the global LGBTQ+ community and equality movement. This year’s Pride Edition Sport Loop showcases a color gradient with the word “pride” woven directly into the band. Apple is also launching a new Shot on iPhone pride campaign on Instagram that captures the essence of artists and figures within the global LGBTQ+ community.
Apple is proud to build on its long-running support for LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations working to bring about positive change, from Encircle, an organization that provides life-affirming programs and services for the LGBTQ+ community and their families, to The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ+ young people. Additional advocacy organizations Apple is supporting include Equality Federation Institute, Equality North Carolina, Equality Texas, Gender Spectrum, GLSEN, Human Rights Campaign, ILGA World, The National Center for Transgender Equality, PFLAG, and SMYAL. Now in its seventh year, the Apple Watch Pride Edition bands and watch faces illustrate the ways in which the company stands with, supports, and is proudly made up of the LGBTQ+ community.
Pride Edition Sport Loop
Members and allies of the LGBTQ+ creative community at Apple were inspired to deliver a new expression of pride through this unique design. Utilizing the comfortable, durable, and adjustable Sport Loop design, Apple used a new technique to remove several of the double-layer nylon-woven textile loops on the band to reveal the word “pride” in a cursive style inspired by the original “hello” greeting — displayed on the first Macintosh in 1984 — giving the word a novel, three-dimensional look and feel.
The team designed a color gradient that incorporates the original rainbow colors with those drawn from various pride flags, including light blue, pink, and white, representing transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, and black and brown, symbolizing Black and Latinx communities. The colors also represent those who are living with or have passed away from HIV/AIDS.
Pride Threads Watch Face
Inspired by multiple pride flags, this new watch face combines colors to represent the strength and mutual support of the LGBTQ+ movement. Mirroring the woven loops of the Sport Loop, each strand of vibrant thread contributes to the overall composition of the watch face. The colorful threads move as the Digital Crown on Apple Watch is rotated, the display is tapped, or the user’s wrist is raised. Apple is also including new App Clip functionality within the band packaging to deliver a simple and convenient way for customers to immediately access the new matching watch face.
Pride Edition Nike Sport Loop
A new Pride Edition Nike Sport Loop celebrates the full spectrum of the rainbow and features a matching rainbow-colored Nike Bounce face that accompanies the new band. Along with Nike’s Be True collection, the Sport Loop honors individuals who are expanding sport for future generations and inspiring others to feel the joy of being authentically themselves. Be True is part of Nike’s broader commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, which focuses on recognition, advocacy, inspiration, and education.
A New Shot on iPhone Pride Campaign
From Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco to Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, the Shot on iPhone pride campaign will showcase imagery from an illustrious group of intersectional creatives, celebrating present-day queer pioneers in places of historic significance to the LGBTQ+ movement. Coming soon to @apple on Instagram, the series will feature works from photographers Ryan McGinley at Stonewall Inn in New York; Evan Benally Atwood at Window Rock in Arizona; Meinke Klein at The Homomonument in Amsterdam; Caia Ramalho at Paulista Avenue in São Paulo; Lydia Metral at Plaza de Chueca in Madrid; and Collier Schorr at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco, featuring Baobei.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple expands Today at Apple Creative Studios, providing new opportunities to young creatives
Select Apple Store locations across the globe will host all-new Creative Studios sessions open to the local community
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple has unveiled plans to bring its Today at Apple Creative Studios initiative to even more young creatives from underrepresented communities around the world. The expanded program offers career-building mentorship, training, and resources across a wide range of artistic disciplines, which now include all-new curricula in app design, podcasting, spatial audio production, and filmmaking. This year, Creative Studios will launch in seven new cities, including Nashville, Miami, Berlin, Milan, Taipei, Tokyo, and Sydney. It will also return for its second year in Chicago; Washington, D.C.; New York City; London; Paris; Bangkok; and Beijing.
“Our stores have long provided a platform to showcase the great talent of local artists, and our retail teams are proud to play a role in supporting creativity within their communities and creating a place where everyone is welcome,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “We’re enormously grateful to our Apple Creative Pros, our retail team members, and local partners, who together make it possible for us to expand access to free arts education and mentorship to even more communities.”
Designed to support young people who face barriers to receiving a quality creative education, Creative Studios connects participants with mentors from Apple and more than 30 nonprofit community partners who specialize in areas such as books and storytelling, app design, radio and podcasts, and photography, film, and TV. Participants will receive hands-on education, training, and feedback on their projects. In addition to nurturing participants’ creative skills, mentors will encourage them to think about how their talents can encourage social change in their communities.
Apple Store locations in select cities will also host public Today at Apple Creative Studios sessions. Led by the established artists mentoring young participants in Creative Studios and Apple Creative Pros, these free events will be open to the public, with registration available atapple.com/today.
“It was an honor to share my passion for Apple technology and storytelling with these young people,” said Rudy P., an Apple Creative Pro at Apple Carnegie Library in Washington. “Technology entered my life at a young age and completely changed my trajectory. My hope for these published authors is that they continue to tell the stories of their lives. The world needs their point of view.”
Last year, over 400 young people participated in Creative Studios programming. Communities celebrated the books, films, and music the participants developed, and showcased participants’ art via Apple TV, Apple Books, and Apple Music.
This year’s program includes:
App Design (New York)
New for this year, Creative Studios New York will provide mentorship, insight, and resources to women and nonbinary creatives as they conceptualize apps to drive social impact.
Books and Storytelling (Miami, Washington)
Young creatives in Washington will hone their skills in creative writing and visual storytelling as they make their own board books, audiobooks, and storyboards. In Miami, Apple joins community partner O, Miami in a program for emerging artists to explore storytelling through the creation of micro audiobooks.
Music, Radio, and Podcasts (Berlin, Nashville, Chicago, Paris)
Aspiring musicians in Berlin will learn about radio production while exploring themes of belonging with guidance from inspiring mentors, working closely with Refuge Worldwide and Open Music Lab. In Nashville, in collaboration with the National Museum of African American Music, the program will specialize in spatial audio recording by granting participants access to Apple Music studios. In Paris, participants will build skills in creative storytelling, audio engineering, and recording through new programming focused on podcasting. And in Chicago, young creatives from the Southwest Side will amplify their own narratives and stories around the theme of belonging and identity through an experience focused on radio production and audio/video experimentation.
Art and Design (Taipei, Milan)
Creative Studios in Taipei and Milan will connect mentors with aspiring young designers as they explore identity while designing, creating, and promoting content that represents themselves and their communities. In Milan, participants will have the opportunity to create an inclusive media landscape through a program that celebrates the diversity of fashion, art, and design led by Afro Fashion, while Taipei’s program will create a safe space for young people to explore gender and identity through creativity. These programs will guide participants through production, provide mentorship and inspiration, and create access to resources and insights from the design industry.
Photography, Film, and TV (London, Sydney, Beijing, Tokyo, Bangkok)
Participants in London and Sydney will explore identity, culture, and representation as they create short documentary films and build skills in cinematography, direction, and editing, with feedback and insight from established artists. In Beijing and Tokyo, participants will receive professional guidance to dive into photography and videography as a means to tell their own stories. In Bangkok, Apple joins community partner Saturday School Foundation for a second year, providing young creatives the opportunity to explore a wide range of Apple-led sessions taught by Apple’s Creative Pro team. This six week in-store program will focus on photography and music creation.

UPDATE
New research highlights job growth, global success of small businesses and entrepreneurs on the App Store
Two independent analyses show the iOS app economy now supports more than 2.2 million jobs in the US, and a 118 percent increase in US small developer earnings over the past two years
The iOS app economy continued its track record as an engine of economic growth and opportunity in 2021, supporting more than 2.2 million jobs in the US and helping small businesses find more success than ever. The insights come as two new research analyses show the iOS app economy’s support for entrepreneurs to create new businesses, to innovate and reach customers through the pandemic, and to grow their teams of coders, designers, and creatives — contributing to one of the most thriving and innovative global markets that exist today.
One new analysis, “Spotlight on Small Business & App Creators on the App Store”—conducted by independent economists from Analysis Group — found that developers’ earnings have increased significantly over the past two years. While earnings for all developers have grown, revenue for smaller developers active on the App Store in 2019 increased by 113 percent over the past two years — outpacing the earnings growth of large developers by more than double. In the US, those smaller developers, defined as those earning up to $1 million a year and with fewer than 1 million annual downloads, saw an above-average increase of 118 percent in earnings since 2019.
Additionally, a separate, new analysis from theProgressive Policy Institutesheds light on job creation in the iOS app economy. This research examines how the iOS app economy has helped create millions of jobs — ranging from software development, to sales, to designers, and more.
Together, this research demonstrates that as more businesses have used apps to reach their customers in innovative ways over the past two years, these digital and hybrid shifts have endured even as COVID-related restrictions have lifted in many parts of the world. These developers and their apps have helped people find new and often lasting ways to collaborate with colleagues, find entertainment, hone their creativity, and connect with friends and family.
Smaller and Emerging Developers Find Global Success on the App Store
In their research, “Spotlight on Small Business & App Creators on the App Store,” economists from Analysis Group examine how entrepreneurs in the iOS app economy have continued to innovate and grow. In total, the research paints a picture of a thriving and dynamic app ecosystem where opportunities and innovations have flourished.
In 2021, thousands of small business and new app creators joined the App Store from all around the world. Of this set of new developers, approximately 24 percent came from Europe, 23 percent from China, 14 percent from the US, 4.3 percent from Japan, and 34 percent from other regions including Korea, India, and Brazil. And over the last two years, the number of smaller and emerging developers joining the App Store has grown — for instance, in the UK, the number of small developers new to the App Store grew by almost 40 percent since 2019, and, in Germany, it grew by over 25 percent.
As these developers take advantage of the App Store’s capabilities that make it easy to distribute apps in 175 global markets, about 40 percent of all downloads of apps from small businesses and emerging app creators came from users outside of the developers’ home countries in 2021.
The research also finds the App Store has helped entrepreneurs start new apps and rapidly scale their businesses. To analyze the paths to growth of developers that earned more than $1 million on the App Store in 2021, the economists looked back at a longer time period and found that 45 percent of today’s large developers were either not on the App Store, or had less than $10,000 in earnings, just five years ago.
Entrepreneurial Paths on the App Store
ThePocketSuitebooking and payments app is built to make it easy for service professionals, either solo or with small teams, to run their entire business. From booking clients and managing payments to invoicing and signing contracts, this app does everything right from an iPhone. Co-founder and CEO Chinwe Onyeagoro, a former management consultant who had transitioned to helping small businesses find funding, saw these businesses weren’t growing because they were always short on cash. “I thought, there has to be a better way for service pros to get paid fast and create recurring revenue — so I went back to my roots as a 7-year-old coming up with ways to make money with friends from a lemonade stand to a babysitting club,” Onyeagoro explains. “I wanted to make it easy for anyone, whether they’re an esthetician, dog trainer, home cleaner, or handyperson, to achieve their goal income so they can live a great life.”
As she shared her vision with her husband, co-founder and CTO Yang Forjindam, they knew they needed a mobile app where professionals who are away from a desk four to five days a week could manage their whole business. Forjindam, who was an enterprise software architect, explains, “I quickly saw that Apple was the easiest platform to develop on,” and taught himself to do so to launch PocketSuite on the App Store in 2016. The team has since become early adopters of technologies like Apple Pay and EventKit that make it simple to offer smart tools to the app’s users. These tools are part of the robust set of technologies Apple provides to help developers of every size create innovative apps, including more than 250,000 software development building blocks (APIs) and more than 40 software development kits (SDKs) to harness the power of machine learning, augmented reality, and other cutting-edge technologies.
Today, not only has the PocketSuite team tripled, going from seven to 25 team members now spread across the world, they’re also realizing their vision of empowering people who work for themselves: After just 45 days with the app, the average user sees a 30 percent increase in income.
Launched in 2017, science-based panic and anxiety relief app Rootd has a simple mission to demystify panic attacks and bring on-the-spot relief to users. As a solo entrepreneur, founder and CEO Ania Wysocka has relied on a variety of resources to help her further build out the business, including Apple’s Small Business Program. Wysocka describes participating in the program, which offers a reduced commission of 15 percent to small developers, as a positive experience that’s made a huge difference for her growth.
In the last year alone,Rootdhas been editorially featured several times on the App Store and experienced a nearly 200 percent year over year increase in billings. “When Apple recognizes a small business like myself, it’s incredibly powerful — helping us be seen by a larger audience around the world. This audience in turn recognizes the raw quality of Rootd, leaving great user reviews and further sharing the app with others in their network. We’ve had a keyword ranking of #1 for panic attacks and #3 for anxiety in the US, and spent a week as the top health and fitness app in Mexico,” said Wysocka. These opportunities are allowing her to build on organic growth in new global storefronts on the App Store, continuing to improve the app experience for users on the way to reaching her next goals of generating $1 million in revenue and reaching 2 million downloads in what she hopes is the near future. “One thing I’ve learned as an entrepreneur is to have goal posts, and opportunities to stop, reflect, and celebrate as much as you can when you reach them.”
Job hiring platformChambaidentified a different trajectory for success. Launching its first app at the start of 2020, Chamba’s goal is to be able to help as many people as possible find jobs throughout the US. As Latin entrepreneurs, co-founders Diego Montemayor and David Ruiz saw a need to create an employment resource for the Hispanic community, traditionally impacted by high numbers of unemployment. The need for the app became even more apparent as people navigated a fluctuating job market throughout the pandemic, and turned to their phones to find jobs that had previously often come through “word of mouth.” As Montemayor explains, “In early 2020, I was unemployed trying to launch a business when the whole country was laying people off, but thankfully Chamba made it through and better than that, we’re growing.”
Chamba has quickly gained popularity in cities like Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York City, allowing the team to grow from a team of two to 15 full-time employees. In the last year, Chamba has seen 900 percent growth in job seekers. Now, 66,000 active job seekers are using the platform every month to find employment in areas from hospitality to software engineering. Montemayor shares, “It’s been quite the journey. I’m very lucky to be in this position that allows me to help connect employers to employees and serves all of our Hispanic communities throughout the US, which have too often been overlooked.”

Swupnil Sahai and his co‑founder serve an ace with AI‑powered SwingVision
The performance-tracking iPhone app looks to make tennis more accessible than ever
While Swupnil Sahai hasn’t stepped out onto the hallowed clay at the French Open or the grass court at Wimbledon, he owes his livelihood to tennis — a passion he traces back to his childhood.
Growing up in the Bay Area, the CEO and co-founder of tennis performance-tracking app SwingVision — only available on the App Store — spent much of his time out on the court. An early interest stoked by his father led Sahai to play on his high school tennis team, and eventually the sport served as a form of stress relief while he attended the University of California, Berkeley.
While working as an engineer on a team that used 3D object tracking to help refine autonomous driving, Sahai — a two-time WWDC scholar — had an epiphany: The same techniques and principles he was using on the job could help him level up on the tennis court. However, the tools that were available on the market for tracking and analyzing his game were expensive, cumbersome, and often hard to come by.
“Back then, you had a few companies making sensors you could attach to your rackets, and they would track some data,” Sahai elaborates. “And in terms of using cameras, the closest thing was this 10-camera system that some high-end clubs had, but it was around $10,000 a court.”
When Apple Watch launched in April 2015, Sahai recognized the potential of a device that would bring intelligence right to a user’s wrist. The seed for the idea that ultimately became SwingVision began to sprout.
“That sparked my brain right away. I thought, ‘If I have a computer on my wrist, I could actually analyze my form and my strokes,’” he says, looking back at the initial notes he made on his iPhone.
After teaching himself how to code using Apple’s Swift programming language, Sahai enlisted the services of his college roommate and fellow tennis enthusiast, Richard Hsu. What began as a side project called Swing — released as an Apple Watch app in 2016 — eventually morphed into a full-time endeavor, necessitating a team that’s since grown to include 12 employees.
Sahai and Hsu then officially launched SwingVision on the App Store in November 2019, harnessing the power of Apple’s Neural Engine in iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, combined with the minds of advisors and investors such as Andy Roddick and James Blake. “That’s really been the big difference: the machine learning processing that’s possible,” he says.
The app recently launched a new function that enables tennis enthusiasts to contest out-of-bounds calls right from their wrists using Apple Watch. “It’s almost pushing the limits of humanity because it allows you to call lines more accurately than you could with your own eyes,” Sahai says. “Everything we've been able to do in terms of processing video in real time — getting insights right away, allowing users to challenge line calls right there on the court — none of that would be possible without the Neural Engine.”
The other major difference: the App Store, which spotlighted SwingVision as an App of the Day in 2021 and brought the app to the feeds of millions of customers instantaneously.
“The App Store does a good job of surfacing apps that are going to be relevant to the customerandshowcasing small apps, not necessarily just the big ones,” Sahai explains. “Being featured as App of the Day has been tremendous for us, not just in generating downloads the day of, but also in becoming a badge of approval that continues to add credibility in conversations with potential customers, investors, and employees for several months afterward.”
“The App Store gives a platform for small teams and even individuals to reach such a massive audience without having to spend a massive budget on marketing,” he continues. “The developer and app stories featured on the Today tab in particular are so powerful because they tell a deeper story that helps build branding, which is very difficult for a team of any size to accomplish.”
Today, SwingVision has over 10,000 monthly users and counting — and there’s much more to come, thanks to ARKit, Apple’s augmented reality development framework for iOS and iPadOS mobile devices. Using ARKit, Sahai anticipates being able to add graphics right onto the court — an exciting prospect, he says, given the livestreaming capabilities the company is currently working on incorporating into the app.
He imagines a future where all tennis matches are livestreamed by default, one in which parents who once had to miss their kids’ big matches are able to tune in remotely from wherever they are, thanks to a well-positioned iPhone or iPad running SwingVision. The device could almost instantaneously transmit a video feed without using too much battery or sacrificing quality.
For coaches and players, a major advantage SwingVision provides is the ability to rewatch and analyze a match recorded in the app on their favorite devices soon after it’s over. At present, SwingVision is seeing particular growth in the college arena, Sahai says, with more than 30 Division I teams currently using the app and many others expected to come on board this summer.
The app is also starting to catch on with a certain segment of professionals looking to crack into the sport’s upper echelon: “players outside of the top 200 who don’t have the million-dollar contracts or coaches who can travel with them all the time,” Sahai elaborates.
“Pros usually have access to this data in matches that they play in the stadium,” he adds, “but even if you’re a professional player like Serena Williams, the vast majority of your time playing tennis is on a practice court.”
The SwingVision team is also working on adding remote coaching to the app, creating new possibilities untethered by the limits of physical geography, especially for aspiring players who live in countries that don’t have top coaches nearby.
“This will make the development of tennis more accessible,” Sahai says, looking ahead at the future of the sport. “That’s always been a problem people have perceived: the notion that you need more money to be able to play it. I think we’re going to be able to break that barrier.”

2022-06-01,Decrease,App Store stopped nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2021,"Text of this article
June 1, 2022
UPDATE
App Store stopped nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2021
Prevented over 1.6 million risky and untrustworthy apps and app updates from defrauding users throughout the year
Apple is dedicated to keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for people to discover and download apps. A key pillar in that effort is Apple’s ongoing work detecting and taking action against bad actors who seek to defraud developers and users.
Bad actors continue to evolve their methods of online fraud, often making their schemes harder to recognize. That is why Apple has continued to refine its processes, create new ones, and engineer solutions to take on these threats.
Last year, Apple released an inaugural fraud prevention analysis, which showed that in 2020 alone, Apple’s combination of sophisticated technology and human expertise protected customers from more than $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, preventing the attempted theft of their money, information, and time — and kept nearly a million problematic new apps out of their hands.
Today, Apple is releasing an annual update to that analysis: In 2021, Apple protected customers from nearly $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, and stopped over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates from defrauding users.
Apple’s efforts to prevent and reduce fraud on the App Store require continuous monitoring and vigilance across multiple teams. From App Review to Discovery Fraud, Apple’s ongoing commitment to protect users from fraudulent app activity demonstrates once again why independent, respected security experts have said the App Store is the safest place to find and download apps.
App Review
The App Review process is multilayered, and combines computer automation with manual human review. App Review uses proprietary tools that leverage machine learning, heuristics, and data accumulated since the App Store first launched, which helps to quickly extract large volumes of information about an app’s potential issues and violations.
Human review is the distinguishing component of the App Review process. The App Review team reviews every app and every update to ensure they follow the App Store’sguidelinesrelated to privacy, security, and spam. This process serves as a critical line of defense to help protect users from bad actors.
App Review’s goal is always to help get quality, new apps on the App Store.
In 2021, App Review helped over 107,000 new developers get their apps onto the store. This process can be iterative, since sometimes apps may be unfinished or contain bugs that impede functionality when they are first submitted for approval, or they might need to make improvements in its moderation mechanisms for user-generated content. In 2021, over 835,000 problematic new apps, and an additional 805,000 app updates, were rejected or removed for a range of reasons like those. As part of the App Review process, any developer who feels they have been incorrectly flagged for fraud may file an appeal to the App Review Board.
A smaller group of these rejections were for flagrant violations that could harm users or deeply diminish their experience. In 2021 alone, the App Review team rejected more than 34,500 apps for containing hidden or undocumented features, and upward of 157,000 apps were rejected because they were found to be spam, copycats, or misleading to users, such as manipulating them into making a purchase.
Sometimes, nefarious developers try to circumvent App Review by creating an app that appears one way, only to alter its concept or functionality once it’s been approved. When Apple finds instances of this sort of fraud, App Review rejects or removes such apps from the store immediately, and the impacted developers receive a 14-day appeals process notice prior to termination. In 2021, over 155,000 apps were removed from the App Store for these kinds of violations.
App Review plays a big role in Apple’s efforts to protect user privacy, which Apple believes is a fundamental human right. App submissions are reviewed to ensure user data is being handled appropriately. In 2021, the App Review team rejected over 343,000 apps for requesting more user data than necessary or mishandling data they already collected.
Apple’s Developer Code of Conduct makes clear that developers who engage in repeated manipulative or misleading behavior — or any other fraudulent conduct — will be removed from the Apple Developer Program. This same code also requires developers to represent themselves and their offerings on the App Store accurately and honestly, refrain from engaging in behavior that can manipulate any element of the App Store customer experience, and maintain high-quality content, services, and experiences for customers.
If users have concerns about an app, they can report it by clicking on theReport a Problemfeature on the App Store or calling Apple Support, and developers can use either of those methods or additional channels likeFeedback AssistantandApple Developer Support.
Fraudulent Ratings and Reviews
App Store ratings and reviews serve as a resource for users and developers alike. Many iOS users have come to depend on this feature as a way to help decide whether to download an app, or which app option best suits their needs. In turn, these ratings and reviews help improve discoverability on the App Store, and provide meaningful intelligence to developers who take this feedback and improve their apps’ features and offerings accordingly.
Illegitimate ratings and reviews pose a serious risk to the App Store, as this sort of deception can lead users to download — and in many cases, buy — an untrustworthy app that attempts to game the system through misrepresentation, rather than provide the quality experience users expect from the App Store. Trust in this system is of the utmost importance, and Apple’s antifraud initiatives help maintain its integrity. A refined system that combines technology and human review by expert teams allows Apple to moderate ratings and reviews.
With more than 1 billion ratings and reviews processed throughout 2021, Apple systematically detected and blocked over 94 million reviews and over 170 million ratings from publication for failing to meet moderation standards. An additional 610,000 reviews were also removed after publication based on customer concern submissions and additional human evaluation.
Account Fraud
When developer accounts are used for fraudulent purposes in a deceitful or especially egregious fashion, the offending developer’s Apple Developer Program account is terminated. While these people or entities deploy elaborate techniques to obscure their actions, Apple monitors to ensure related accounts are terminated quickly. As a result of these efforts, Apple terminated over 802,000 developer accounts in 2021. An additional 153,000 developer enrollments were rejected over fraud concerns, preventing these bad actors from submitting an app to the store.
In an effort to protect users who download apps beyond the safe and trusted App Store, over the last 12 months, Apple found and blocked over 63,500 illegitimate apps on pirate storefronts. These storefronts distribute malicious software often designed to resemble popular apps — or that modify popular apps without their developers’ authorization — while circumventing the App Store’s security protections.
Over the past month alone, Apple has blocked more than 3.3 million instances of apps distributed illicitly through itsEnterprise Developer Program, which is designed to enable large organizations to develop and privately distribute their own apps for internal use. Offenders have sought to exploit this program in an attempt to flout App Review or involve a legitimate enterprise by compromising an insider to leak credentials needed to ship illicit content.
Apple takes action on fraudulent customers accounts, too. In 2021, Apple deactivated over 170 million customer accounts associated with fraudulent and abusive activity. If an account exhibits similar behaviors to those that have engaged in previous abuse, they’re deactivated before they can be used at all. In addition, more than 118 million attempted account creations were rejected in 2021 because they displayed patterns consistent with fraudulent and abusive activity.
Rooting out fraud on an account level helps curb this sort of dishonest behavior, and present users with more accurate information on the relative quality and popularity of an app on the App Store.
Payment and Credit Card Fraud
For many people, no data is more sensitive than their financial information. That’s why Apple has invested enormously in creating more secure payment technologies like Apple Pay and StoreKit. These technologies are used by more than 905,000 apps to sell goods and services on the App Store. For example, with Apple Pay, credit card numbers are never shared with merchants — eliminating a risk factor in the payment transaction process.
As with all forms of fraud, Apple takes credit card fraud extremely seriously and is committed to protecting the App Store and its users from this sort of distress. In 2021 alone, as a result of a combination of technology and human review, more than 3.3 million stolen cards were prevented from being used to make potentially fraudulent purchases, and banned nearly 600,000 accounts from transacting again. In total, Apple protected users from nearly $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions in 2021.
Apple’s efforts keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for users to find and download apps, and for developers to do what they do best: create. To help ensure that trusted ecosystem is sustained for years to come, Apple will continue working to detect fraudulent activity and accounts, and prevent financial crimes.

2022-06-03,Decrease,Apple’s WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge winners help communities through coding,"Text of this article
June 3, 2022
UPDATE
Apple’s WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge winners help communities through coding
Every year, in the lead-up to Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, young people from around the globe use Swift Playgrounds to showcase their coding skills. This year, as part of the Swift Student Challenge, they include submissions from first-time participants Jones Mays II, Angelina Tsuboi, and Josh Tint.
All three teens are harnessing the power of coding to create apps that help solve problems in their communities — and are among more than 350 students from 40 countries and regions who have been selected as 2022 challenge winners.
The Swift Student Challenge is just one part of WWDC22, along with the keynote, events, labs, and workshops available online and free to the over-30-million-strong global Apple developer community. And when programming begins on June 6, Mays, Tsuboi, and Tint will be among those tuning in for the latest technologies, tools, and frameworks to help them build on their already impressive coding skills to create the next generation of groundbreaking apps.
When Jones Mays II, 17, designed his winning Swift Playgrounds submission, an app called Ivy, he found inspiration in his own roots.
“My grandfather had a garden that he loved, and he grew so much food that he just allowed people from the community to come in and grab what they needed,” said Mays, who is about to start his senior year of high school in Houston, Texas. “Even though he couldn’t walk at the end of his life, he used to point and that’s where I’d put down the seeds for him. But we always had to try to get rid of the kudzu vine — it was an ongoing fight.”
And so Mays decided to create an app that honored his grandfather, who passed away a few years ago, by helping other gardeners identify and get rid of invasive plants like kudzu.
“I’ve just really enjoyed being able to build programs that are able to display my creativity and passion in a fun and easy way,” said Mays. “Swift has been a big part of that — I discovered it about a year ago and I love how easy it is to use.”
This summer, Jones is going to be helping others learn programming languages like Swift.
“I’ll be teaching the next generation of students what it means to learn computer science,” said Mays. “Because I truly believe that when you’re able to learn computer science, you are able to apply that to so many other fields.”
It’s no surprise to Mays that teaching has become part of his journey — he comes from a long line of educators. They include his mother, brother, and his late grandfather, who Mays thinks would approve of the app created in his honor.
“He was a man of few words,” said Mays. “But I think he’d say, ‘Squirt, you did a good job.’”
When it comes to tackling problems, 16-year-old Angelina Tsuboi, who lives in Redondo Beach, California, can’t pick just one.
In addition to her winning Swift Playgrounds submission that teaches the basics of CPR, she also helped build a prototype that monitors air quality, created a website to help search and rescue organizations, and designed a school communication program that won the Congressional App Challenge in her district.
“Life is riddled with problems — everyone is struggling with at least one thing,” said Tsuboi. “And programming filled me with this sense of hope. It gave me a way to help identify problems that people in my community or my friends were facing and use my skill set to help them.”
The project that’s closest to her heart is an app called Lilac, which she launched on the App Store in March.
“My mom is a single mother and she’s from Japan,” said Tsuboi. “When she came here, she had problems with the language, so I made an app where you can find resources such as childcare or housing or grant opportunities, and translators in the community to help you connect with them.”
That sense of service permeates everything that Tsuboi does and keeps her searching for new projects to tackle.
“Helping others helps you remain humble and connected to your community,” said Tsuboi. “It makes the world seem like a nicer place and fills me with a sense of joy — I’m able to at least do one thing that helps relieve the chaos in the world.”
Josh Tint loves words. The 19-year-old from Tucson, Arizona just finished his freshman year at Arizona State University and is focusing his studies on linguistics — specifically lavender linguistics, which is the study of the language used by the LGBTQ+ community.
For his winning Swift Playgrounds, Tint designed an app that enables people who are questioning their gender identity to try different pronouns.
“An algorithm will insert different pronouns into pieces of sample text,” said Tint. “You can swipe through the sample text — left or right to indicate whether you like it or not — to get a feel for whether you think a certain gender pronoun matches your identity.”
The inspiration for the app came from Tint’s own journey.
“I’ve questioned my gender identity and so I know there aren’t many resources out there to help with that,” said Tint. “So I wanted to try to build a tool that I thought was more applicable to my experience and could help others, too. I wanted my app to help tell a story.”
Tint taught himself to code at the beginning of high school and designed an algorithm to dissect and build poems. He used it to enter a poem into the school poetry contest — and won.
He has since taught himself Swift and thinks it lends itself to his work in linguistics.
“I really like Swift’s natural language framework,” said Tint. “It’s really powerful and great for scripting — I’ve used it to build machine learning models to help analyze speech.”
In the future, Tint wants to use his knowledge of linguistics and programming to design algorithms that help mitigate bias.
“Right now, so much of the work done is only in a few languages, and it reflects the biases of the people who write it,” said Tint. “We should address those limitations and start building new models with more parameters and larger, more inclusive data sets. If we don’t include the stories of marginalized communities in those core processes right now, it’s going to be very difficult to undo that damage later.”
Apple is proud to support and uplift the next generation of developers, creators, and entrepreneurs through its annual WWDC student program. Over the past three decades, thousands of students have built successful careers in technology, founded venture-backed startups, and created organizations focused on democratizing technology and innovating to build a better future.

UPDATE
Apple announces winners of the 2022 Apple Design Awards
Twelve developers from around the world are recognized for design excellence in inclusivity, delight and fun, interaction, social impact, visuals and graphics, and innovation at WWDC22
Apple today hosted its annual Apple Design Awards, celebrating 12 best-in-class apps and games. This year’s winners include developers from around the world who were selected for delivering innovative, creative, and beautifully designed experiences through apps that inspired users with vision, purpose, and brilliance.
For the second year, six different categories recognize one app and game each for inclusivity, delight and fun, interaction, social impact, visuals and graphics, and innovation. The winners were chosen from 36 finalists, all of which have demonstrated outstanding technical achievement.
“As apps and games remain an essential part of our lives, we’re excited by the ways that developers continue to use our technologies to create standout apps for people everywhere,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “The work of this year’s Apple Design Award winners embodies how apps can be transformative, uplifting, or even provide an escape through creative gameplay — and we congratulate each developer for all they’ve accomplished.”
Inclusivity
Winners in this category provide a great experience for all by supporting people from a diversity of backgrounds, abilities, and languages.
App:ProcreateDeveloper:Savage Interactive (Australia)
Procreate, a world-class tool for artists and designers, brings people more creative power than ever through its iPad app. With new accessibility features — such as tremor and motion filtering, an in-app assistive touch menu, audio feedback, and color blindness settings — to augment its support of VoiceOver, Dynamic Type, and more, the app empowers more artists to create, interact, and express themselves.

PRESS RELEASE
iPadOS 16 takes the versatility of iPad even further with powerful new productivity and collaboration features
Introducing an entirely new multitasking experience with Stage Manager and full external display support, new ways to collaborate via Messages, big updates to Mail and Safari, iCloud Shared Photo Library, pro features including Reference Mode and Display Zoom, and more
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewediPadOS 16, a major update that makes the iPad experience even more versatile. Taking advantage of the power of the M1 chip, Stage Manager brings a new way to multitask with multiple overlapping windows and full external display support. Collaboration is easier than ever with new ways to start working with others in apps across the system using Messages, and the new Freeform app provides a flexible canvas to brainstorm on together. New tools in Mail help users be more productive, Safari adds shared Tab Groups to browse the web with others, and the browsing experience gets even more secure with passkeys. The new Weather app takes full advantage of the stunning iPad display, and Live Text now interacts with text in video. New pro features — including Reference Mode and Display Zoom — make iPad an even more powerful mobile studio. Combined with the power of Apple silicon, iPadOS 16 makes it faster and easier to get more done on iPad.
“iPad is our most versatile device, and we’re excited to take what it can do even further with iPadOS 16,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “With Stage Manager, which takes multitasking on iPad to a whole new level, plus new ways to share and collaborate via Messages, Safari, and the new Freeform app, and new pro features like Reference Mode and Display Zoom, users can get even more done on iPad.”
New Ways to Share and Connect in Messages
New features in Messages make it easy to start collaborating and manage shared content across Files, Keynote, Numbers, Pages, Notes, Reminders, and Safari, as well as third-party apps. When users send an invitation to collaborate via Messages, everyone on the thread is automatically added to the document, spreadsheet, or project. When someone makes a change to a shared file, everyone can see updates right at the top of the Messages thread. And when a user is working on a collaborative project, they can easily jump into the associated Messages conversation or just tap to start a FaceTime call with their collaborators.
iPadOS 16 makes everyday messaging even better. Users can now edit or recall recently sent messages, recover recently deleted messages, and mark conversations as unread so they can come back to them later.1Additionally, users can now begin a SharePlay session via Messages, so they can choose a shared activity — like a movie, TV show, workout, or game — and enjoy it together in sync while chatting via Messages.
A Real-Time Collaboration Space Using Freeform
Freeform, a powerful new collaboration app with a flexible canvas, gives users the ability to see, share, and collaborate all in one place without worrying about layouts and page sizes, and with full support for Apple Pencil. Users can view others’ contributions as they add content or make edits, all while enjoying a real-time collaboration space. Coming to iPadOS 16 later this year, Freeform allows collaborators to start a session from FaceTime and see the updates from others right in the Messages thread.
Mail Introduces New Smart Tools
Being more productive is easier than ever with new tools introduced in Mail. Users are given a moment to cancel delivery of a message before it reaches a recipient’s inbox,2schedule emails to be sent at the perfect moment, and move sent emails to the top of their inbox to quickly send a follow-up. Messages can also be resurfaced at any date and time with Remind Later, and users can get notified if they forget to include an important part of the message, like an attachment or recipient. Additionally, an all-new search experience delivers more complete and accurate results by correcting typos and using synonyms for the search terms, and allows users to see a richer view of contacts, shared content, and more.
Relive Memories with the New iCloud Shared Photo Library
iCloud Shared Photo Library is the easiest way to share photos seamlessly and automatically among up to six family members, so everyone can collaborate and enjoy the collection in Memories, Featured Photos, and the Photos widget. Users can share all their past photos, or use setup tools to contribute specific photos based on a start date or people in the photos. Photos can be added to the collection manually, or through Bluetooth proximity or sharing suggestions in For You. When anyone in the Shared Library adds, edits, or deletes photos, the library is updated for everyone.
New Collaboration and Security Features Come to Safari
Safari gets big updates, making it even more collaborative, customizable, and secure. Shared Tab Groups allow users to collaborate on a set of tabs with friends and see updates instantly while they work together, share tabs and bookmarks, and start a conversation right from Safari. Tab Groups get dedicated start pages that can be customized with a background image, bookmarks, and unique sections everyone can see and edit.
Browsing in Safari is even more secure with passkeys, an easier and safer sign-in method designed to replace passwords on the web and in apps. Passkeys are kept on iPad and are specific to the sites users create them for. And since passkeys are unique digital keys that stay on device and are never stored on a web server, hackers can’t leak them or trick users into sharing them. Users can sign in to websites or apps on Apple and non-Apple devices with their saved passkey by scanning the QR code with iPad, and using Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate.
The Weather App Comes to iPad
Designed to take full advantage of the stunning display, Weather comes to iPad with beautiful animations. With just a tap, users can see the most important weather information, or explore maps to check precipitation, air quality, and temperature. Users can also be notified when a severe weather alert is issued in their area, or check the air quality using a color-coded scale.
Live Text and Visual Look Up Get Powerful Updates
Using on-device intelligence, Live Text recognizes text in images across the system, and the feature now comes to video, making text completely interactive in paused video frames. With a single tap on a video, users can quickly translate languages or convert currencies. And Visual Look Up now allows users to lift the subject from an image or isolate a subject by removing the background with just a tap, and expands its recognition capabilities to birds, insects, statues, and more.
Pro Features Take Demanding Workflows Even Further
iPadOS 16 brings new powerful features that make iPad Pro an indispensable tool for creative professionals. Reference Mode enables the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with Liquid Retina XDR display to match the color requirements in workflows like review and approve, color grading, and compositing, where accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical.
Powered by the performance of the Apple-designed M1 chip, Display Zoom now allows users to increase the pixel density of the display so they can view more in their apps, which is especially useful when using Split View. With Virtual Memory Swap, iPad storage can be used to expand the available memory for all apps, and delivers up to 16 gigabytes of memory for the most demanding apps, helping to make multitasking absolutely seamless.
Powerful Multitasking with Stage Manager and Full External Display Support
Stage Manager is an entirely new multitasking experience that automatically organizes apps and windows, making it quick and easy to switch between tasks. For the first time on iPad, users can create overlapping windows of different sizes in a single view, drag and drop windows from the side, or open apps from the Dock to create groups of apps for faster, more flexible multitasking. The window of the app users are working on is displayed prominently in the center, and other open apps and windows are arranged on the left-hand side in order of recency.
Available on iPad Pro and iPad Air with the M1 chip, Stage Manager also unlocks full external display support with resolutions of up to 6K, so users can arrange the ideal workspace, and work with up to four apps on iPad and four apps on the external display.
Additional iPadOS 16 Features
Availability
The developer preview of iPadOS 16 is available to Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today, and a public beta will be available to iPadOS users next month atbeta.apple.com. New software features will be available this fall as a free software update for iPad (5th generation and later), iPad mini (5th generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), and all iPad Pro models.

June 6, 2022
PRESS RELEASE
macOS Ventura adds powerful productivity tools and new Continuity features that make the Mac experience better than ever
New features like Stage Manager help Mac users stay focused and get more done
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewedmacOS Ventura, the latest version of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, which takes the Mac experience to a whole new level. Stage Manager gives Mac users an all-new way to stay focused on the task in front of them while seamlessly switching between apps and windows. Continuity Camera uses iPhone as the webcam on Mac to do things that were never possible before,1and with Handoff coming to FaceTime, users can start a FaceTime call on their iPhone or iPad and fluidly pass it over to their Mac. Mail and Messages come with great new features that make the apps better than ever, while Safari — the world’s fastest browser on Mac2— ushers in a passwordless future with passkeys. And with the power and popularity of Apple silicon, and new developer tools in Metal 3, gaming on Mac has never been better.
“macOS Ventura includes powerful features and new innovations that help make the Mac experience even better. New tools like Stage Manager make focusing on tasks and moving between apps and windows easier and faster than ever, and Continuity Camera brings new videoconferencing features to any Mac, including Desk View, Studio Light, and more,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “With helpful new features in Messages, state-of-the-art search technologies in Mail, and an updated design for Spotlight, Ventura has so much to offer and enriches many of the ways customers use their Macs.”
A New Way to Work Across Apps and Windows
Stage Manager automatically organizes open apps and windows so users can concentrate on their work and still see everything in a single glance. The current window users are working in is displayed prominently in the center, and other open windows appear on the left-hand side so they can quickly and easily switch between tasks. Users can also group windows together when working on specific tasks or projects that require different apps. Stage Manager works in concert with other macOS windowing tools — including Mission Control and Spaces — and users can now easily get to their desktop with a single click.
Apple Devices Working Together with Continuity
Continuity Cameranow gives Mac customers the ability to use their iPhone as a webcam, and unlocks new capabilities that were never possible before on a webcam. With the power of Continuity, Mac can automatically recognize and use the camera on iPhone when it is nearby — without the need to wake or select it — and iPhone can even connect to Mac wirelessly for greater flexibility.3Continuity Camera delivers innovative features to all Mac computers including Center Stage, Portrait mode, and the new Studio Light — an effect that beautifully illuminates a user’s face while dimming the background. Plus, Continuity Camera taps into the Ultra Wide camera on iPhone to enable Desk View, which simultaneously shows the user’s face and an overhead view of their desk — great for creating DIY videos, showing off sketches over FaceTime, and so much more.4
Handoff now comes to FaceTime, allowing users to start a FaceTime call on one Apple device and seamlessly transfer it to another Apple device nearby. Users can be on a FaceTime call on iPhone or iPad, then move the call to their Mac with just a click, or start a call on their Mac and shift to iPhone or iPad when they need to continue on the go.
Powerful Updates to Key macOS Apps and Features
Safari offers the fastest and most power-efficient browsing experience on the Mac, along with trailblazing privacy features. In macOS Ventura, Safari introduces a powerful new way for users to browse together: With shared Tab Groups, friends, family, and colleagues can share their favorite sites in Safari and see what tabs others are looking at live. Users can also build a list of bookmarks on a shared Start Page, and even start a Messages conversation or FaceTime call right from Safari — great for planning a trip or researching a project together.
In the biggest overhaul to search in years, Mail now uses state-of-the-art techniques to deliver more relevant, accurate, and complete results. Users can quickly find what they are looking for as soon as they click into search, including recent emails, contacts, documents, photos, and more, all before they even start typing. Users can also schedule emails and even cancel delivery after hitting send,5and Mail now intelligently detects if items such as an attachment or cc’d recipient is missing from their message. In Mail, users can set reminders to come back to a message at a particular date and time, and receive automatic suggestions to follow up on an email if there has been no response.
Messages on the Mac now includes the ability to edit or undo a recently sent message, mark a message as unread, or even recover accidentally deleted messages.6New collaboration features make working with others quick and seamless. Now, when a user shares a file via Messages using the share sheet or drag and drop, they can choose to share a copy or collaborate. When they choose to collaborate, everyone on a Messages thread is automatically added. And when someone makes an edit to the shared document, activity updates appear at the top of the thread. Users can also join SharePlay sessions from their Mac right in Messages, so they can chat and participate in synchronized experiences.
Spotlight includes an updated design that makes navigation easier, new features that provide a more consistent experience across Apple devices, and Quick Look for quickly previewing files. Users can now find images in their photo library, across the system, and on the web. They can even search for their photos by location, people, scenes, or objects, and Live Text lets them search by text inside images. To be even more productive, users can now take actions from Spotlight, like starting a timer, creating a new document, or running a shortcut. And Spotlight now includes rich results for artists, movies, actors, and TV shows, as well as businesses and sports.
With iCloud Shared Photo Library, users can now create and share a separate photo library among up to six family members, so everyone can enjoy all of their family photos. Users can choose to share all of their existing photos from their personal libraries, or share based on a start date or people in the photos. To help keep their Shared Library up to date, users will receive intelligent suggestions to share relevant photo moments that include participants in the library and any other people they choose. Every user in the Shared Photo Library can add, delete, edit, or favorite the shared photos and videos, which will appear in each user’s Memories and Featured Photos so that everyone can relive more complete family moments.
More Secure Browsing in Safari
Browsing in Safari is even safer with passkeys, next-generation credentials that are more secure, easy to use, and designed to replace passwords. Passkeys are unique digital keys that stay on device and are never stored on a web server, so hackers can’t leak them or trick users into sharing them. Passkeys make it simple to sign in securely, using Touch ID or Face ID for biometric verification, and iCloud Keychain to sync across Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV with end-to-end encryption. They will also work across apps and the web, and users can even sign in to websites or apps on non-Apple devices using their iPhone.
Immersive Gaming Experiences
The power of Apple silicon enables every new Mac to run AAA games with ease, including upcoming titles such as EA’s GRID Legends and Capcom’s Resident Evil Village. And since Apple silicon also powers iPad, game developers can bring their AAA games to even more users, like No Man’s Sky from Hello Games, which is coming to both Mac and iPad later this year.
Metal 3, the latest version of the software that powers the gaming experience across Apple platforms, introduces new features that take the gaming experience on Mac to new heights and unleash the full potential of Apple silicon for years to come. MetalFX Upscaling enables developers to quickly render complex scenes by using less compute-intensive frames, and then apply resolution scaling and temporal anti-aliasing. The result is accelerated performance that provides gamers with a more responsive feel and graphics that look stunning. Game developers also benefit from a new Fast Resource Loading API that minimizes wait time by providing a more direct path from storage to the GPU, so games can easily access high-quality textures and geometry needed to create expansive worlds for realistic and immersive gameplay.
More Great Experiences Coming with macOS Ventura
Availability
The developer beta of macOS Ventura is available to Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today. A public beta will be available to Mac users next month atbeta.apple.com. macOS Ventura will be available this fall as a free software update.

MacBook Air features a new, strikingly thin design in four beautiful finishes, larger 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, 1080p HD camera, MagSafe charging, and moreM2 also comes to the 13-inch MacBook Pro with 24GB of fast unified memory, ProRes acceleration, and up to 20 hours of battery life
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introduced a completely redesignedMacBook Airand an updated13-inch MacBook Pro, both powered by the new M2 chip — which takes the breakthrough performance and capabilities of M1 even further. MacBook Air takes everything users love about the world’s best-selling laptop to the next level. With an all-new, strikingly thin design and even more performance, MacBook Air also features a larger 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, four-speaker sound system, up to 18 hours of battery life,1and MagSafe charging. It is now available in four finishes — silver, space gray, midnight, and starlight.M2also comes to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the world’s second best-selling laptop — delivering incredible performance, up to 24GB of unified memory, ProRes acceleration, and up to 20 hours of battery life,2all in a compact design. The new MacBook Air and updated 13-inch MacBook Pro join the even more powerful 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max to round out the strongest lineup of Mac notebooks ever offered. Both laptops will be available next month.
“We’re so excited to bring our new M2 chip to the world’s two most popular laptops — the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Completely redesigned around M2, MacBook Air is thinner, lighter, and faster with a bigger display, better camera, and all-day battery life, in four beautiful finishes. Only with Apple silicon can you build such a thin and light notebook with a fanless design, and this combination of performance and capabilities. M2 also comes to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, featuring incredible performance, ProRes acceleration, up to 24GB of memory, and up to 20 hours of battery life — making our most portable pro notebook even better.”
M2 Supercharges Apple’s Most Popular Systems
M2 starts the second generation of Apple’s M-series chips and extends the remarkable features of M1. With industry-leading power efficiency, a unified memory architecture, and custom technologies, this new chip brings even more performance and capabilities to Apple’s most popular Mac notebooks — the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro. M2 features a next-generation 8-core CPU with advancements in both performance and efficiency cores, along with Apple’s next-generation GPU, which now has up to 10 cores — two more than M1. M2 delivers 100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth and supports up to 24GB of fast unified memory, so it can handle even larger and more complex workloads with ease. Designed to dramatically speed up video workflows, M2 also adds a next-generation media engine and a powerful ProRes video engine for hardware-accelerated encode and decode, so systems with M2 will be able to play back more streams of 4K and 8K video than before.
All-New MacBook Air, Completely Redesigned Around M2
Built from the ground up around M2, MacBook Air has an entirely new design that is remarkably thin from every angle. It measures just 11.3 mm thin and is only 2.7 pounds, and features a durable, all-aluminum unibody enclosure that feels incredibly solid and is built to last. This thin and light design integrates its components so efficiently that it results in an astonishing 20 percent reduction in volume. With the power efficiency of M2, all of the capabilities of MacBook Air are built into a silent, fanless design. In addition to silver and space gray, MacBook Air is now available in two new finishes — midnight and starlight.
MagSafe returns to MacBook Air, giving users a dedicated charging port that is easy to connect, while protecting MacBook Air when it is plugged in by quickly releasing if the charging cable is accidentally pulled. MacBook Air also features two Thunderbolt ports for connecting a variety of accessories, and a 3.5 mm audio jack with support for high-impedance headphones. Additionally, the Magic Keyboard features a full-height function row with Touch ID, and a spacious, industry-leading Force Touch trackpad.
New 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display
The new MacBook Air features a gorgeous 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display, which has been expanded closer to the sides and up around the camera to make room for the menu bar. The result is a larger display with much thinner borders, giving users more screen real estate to view their content in brilliant detail. At 500 nits of brightness, it is also 25 percent brighter than before. In addition, the new display now supports 1 billion colors, so photos and movies look incredibly vibrant.
1080p FaceTime HD Camera and Four-Speaker Sound System
MacBook Air includes a new 1080p FaceTime HD camera with a larger image sensor and more efficient pixels that deliver twice the resolution and low-light performance of the previous generation. Combined with the processing power of the advanced image signal processor on M2, users will look great on video calls.
MacBook Air also features a four-speaker sound system. To fit inside such a thin design, the speakers and mics are completely integrated between the keyboard and display — all while delivering an even better audio experience. A three-mic array captures clean audio using advanced beamforming algorithms, while the speakers produce improved stereo separation and vocal clarity. MacBook Air also supports immersive Spatial Audio for music and movies with Dolby Atmos.
Even More Performance in MacBook Air
M2 takes the performance of MacBook Air even further.
New Charging Options
MacBook Air offers a number of charging options, including an all-new 35W compact power adapter with two USB-C ports, so users can charge two devices at once. And for the first time, MacBook Air supports fast charge for charging up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes with an optional 67W USB-C power adapter.7
13-inch MacBook Pro with M2
Users love the performance the 13-inch MacBook Pro delivers in its compact design. Now with M2, Apple’s most portable pro notebook gets even more capabilities in the same great form factor.
macOS Monterey
With macOS Monterey and Apple silicon, MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro deliver even more performance and productivity for users. Continuity tools like Universal Control make it easy for users to work effortlessly across Mac and iPad, while AirPlay to Mac enables users to play just about anything from their iPhone or iPad right to their Mac’s stunning Retina display. FaceTime includes audio and video features, including Portrait mode and Spatial Audio that make calls feel more natural and lifelike, while SharePlay enables Mac users to have shared experiences through FaceTime.14Live Text and Visual Look Up use intelligence to surface useful information, Safari includes powerful tab organization with Tab Groups, and Shortcuts brings the ease of automation to the Mac.
macOS Ventura, coming this fall, will also take full advantage of M2, delivering new features including Stage Manager, and powerful new capabilities with Continuity Camera and Handoff coming to FaceTime. macOS Ventura also includes big updates to Safari, Mail, Messages, Spotlight, and more.
Better for the Environment
Both the new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro minimize their impact on the environment, now using 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in the enclosure magnets. MacBook Air uses 100 percent recycled aluminum in its enclosure and is the first Apple product to use certified recycled steel. Both products meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, are free of numerous harmful substances, and use wood fiber in the packaging that comes from responsibly managed forests. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Mac Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple unveils M2, taking the breakthrough performance and capabilities of M1 even further
M2 delivers new levels of power-efficient performance and capabilities to the completely redesigned MacBook Air and updated 13-inch MacBook Pro
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced M2, beginning the next generation of Apple silicon designed specifically for the Mac. Built using second-generation 5-nanometer technology, M2 takes the industry-leading performance per watt of M1 even further with an 18 percent faster CPU, a 35 percent more powerful GPU, and a 40 percent faster Neural Engine.1It also delivers 50 percent more memory bandwidth compared to M1, and up to 24GB of fast unified memory. M2 brings all of this — plus new custom technologies and greater efficiency — to the completely redesignedMacBook Airand updated 13-inch MacBook Pro.
“M2 starts the second generation of M-series chips and goes beyond the remarkable features of M1,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With our relentless focus on power-efficient performance, M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. And along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like ProRes acceleration, M2 continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac.”
More Transistors, More Memory
The system-on-a-chip (SoC) design of M2 is built using enhanced, second-generation 5-nanometer technology, and consists of 20 billion transistors — 25 percent more than M1. The additional transistors improve features across the entire chip, including the memory controller that delivers 100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth — 50 percent more than M1. And with up to 24GB of fast unified memory, M2 can handle even larger and more complex workloads.
Faster Power-Efficient Performance
The new CPU features faster performance cores paired with a larger cache, while the efficiency cores have been significantly enhanced for even greater performance gains. Together, they deliver 18 percent greater multithreaded performance than M1, so M2 can rip through CPU-intensive tasks using very little power, like creating music with layers of effects or applying complex filters to photos.1Compared with the latest 10-core PC laptop chip, the CPU in M2 provides nearly twice the performance at the same power level. And, M2 delivers the peak performance of the PC chip while using just a quarter of the power.2When compared to the latest 12-core PC laptop chip — which needs dramatically more power to deliver an increase in performance and is therefore found in thicker, hotter, more noisy systems with less battery life — M2 provides nearly 90 percent of the peak performance of the 12-core chip while using just one-fourth the power.3
M2 also features Apple’s next-generation GPU with up to 10 cores — two more than M1. Combined with a larger cache and higher memory bandwidth, the 10-core GPU delivers a big boost in graphics performance, bringing up to 25 percent higher graphics performance than M1 at the same power level, and up to 35 percent better performance at its max power.1Compared with the integrated graphics of the latest PC laptop chip, the GPU in M2 delivers 2.3x faster performance at the same power level, and matches its peak performance using a fifth of the power.2The higher performance per watt from M2 enables systems to have exceptional battery life, and run cool and quietly, even when playing graphics-intensive games or editing massive RAW images.
Apple’s Next-Generation Custom Technologies
M2 brings Apple’s latest custom technologies to the Mac, enabling new capabilities, better security, and more:
macOS, M2, and Apps
macOS has been designed for Apple silicon, and the combination of macOS Monterey and the powerful new M2 delivers breakthrough performance and productivity for users. Mac computers powered with Apple silicon have access to the largest collection of apps ever for Mac, including iPhone and iPad apps that can run on Mac, and universal apps that unlock the full power of M-series chips.
macOS Ventura, coming this fall, will also take full advantage of M2, bringing new features including Stage Manager, and powerful new capabilities with Continuity Camera and Handoff in FaceTime. macOS Ventura also includes big updates to Safari, Mail, Messages, Spotlight, and more.
Apple Silicon and the Environment
The power-efficient performance of M2 helps the new MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every chip Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple provides developers with even more powerful technologies to push the app experience forward
New APIs offer deeper platform integration and greater capabilities for third-party apps
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today unveiled new tools, technologies, and APIs designed to help developers create even richer experiences for their users. Widgets on the Lock Screen enable developers to surface key information from their apps in a new way, while other new APIs across Apple’s platforms help them build more unique features. WeatherKit gives developers the ability to integrate Apple Weather forecast data directly into their apps, and Xcode Cloud — Apple’s continuous integration and delivery service built into Xcode — is now available to every Apple Developer Program member to help them create higher-quality apps, faster. Metal 3 enables gaming developers to create breathtaking graphics with accelerated performance, and developing for Apple’s platforms is now even more intuitive with improvements to Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode. And with improvements to SKAdNetwork, ad networks and developers can better measure how ads perform while still preserving user privacy.
“We love collaborating with our developer community and providing them with new innovative technologies that enable them to build the next great generation of apps,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing. “With powerful new APIs for widgets on the Lock Screen, new services like WeatherKit, the availability of Xcode Cloud to help every Apple developer build apps faster, and new gaming capabilities with Metal 3, developers have more tools than ever to create app experiences that their users will love.”
Xcode Cloud Now Available
Xcode Cloud is now available with a range of subscription plans to best fit developers’ needs, starting with 25 hours per month free through December 2023 to all members of the Apple Developer Program and topping out at 1,000 hours per month.
Built into Xcode, Xcode Cloud is a continuous integration and delivery cloud service designed specifically for Apple developers. It enables developers and teams of all sizes to build, test, and deliver high-quality apps even more efficiently by automatically building apps in the cloud to free up their Mac for other tasks. And with parallel testing in the cloud, developers can test on a simulated version of every current Apple device, easily deploy a build for internal testing, or deliver to beta testers through TestFlight.
Developers can find more information on available plans for Xcode Cloudhere.
Xcode 14 Improvements
Xcode 14 features new enhancements to further improve developer productivity. Project builds are up to 25 percent faster, thanks to improved parallelism, and the Xcode application is now 30 percent smaller to download, with downloadable simulator runtimes for watchOS and tvOS. The new multiplatform target creates a single SwiftUI interface for use across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. Developer code is easier to maintain yet highly customizable to take advantage of each platform’s unique capabilities. SwiftUI live previews are now interactive by default in Xcode, so changes are immediately live, and developers can create variants of each preview without writing any code, altering the color scheme, text size, device orientation, or accessibility modes. The new App Icon feature in Assets Catalog allows developers to provide a single icon size for all platforms, and Xcode automatically generates all the required assets for the app. Xcode includes language and editing enhancements with smarter autocompletion, and additional dynamic snippets get developers to the code they want to write faster.
New Gaming Capabilities
Metal 3 — the latest version of Apple’s graphics framework — comes with new features that enable game developers to tap into the power of Apple silicon for even greater gaming performance. MetalFX Upscaling enables developers to quickly render complex scenes by using less compute-intensive frames, and then apply high-quality spatial upscaling and temporal anti-aliasing. The result is accelerated performance that makes games feel more responsive and graphics that look stunning. Game developers also benefit from a new Fast Resource Loading API that minimizes wait time by providing a more direct path from storage to the GPU, so games can easily access high-quality textures and geometry needed to create expansive worlds for realistic and immersive gameplay.
Game developers that integrate with Game Center can now add Activity views into the dashboard, making it possible for their users to see which games their friends are playing and their high scores. And with SharePlay support, it’s easier than ever for users to play together in real time.
Enhancements to Swift and SwiftUI
Swift and SwiftUI offer the best way to build an app, and now come with new features that streamline the development process.
Swift adds a powerful string processing capability with new regular expression literal support built directly into the language, allowing developers to quickly check the correctness of their regular expressions and extract information with less code. With new Package Plugins available in Swift Package Manager, it’s now easier for developers to run custom commands on their projects, and even upload and share the commands with others.
SwiftUI, Apple’s next-generation user interface framework, features an enhanced navigation API to make it easier for developers to control how their app moves from view to view. With Custom Layouts, developers can go beyond common app layouts and create versions that work best for their app designs. And Swift Charts can be customized to almost any charting need so developers can better visualize the data in their apps.
Introducing WeatherKit
WeatherKit enables developers to integrate the same world-class global weather forecast that powers Apple Weather directly into their apps. Using high-resolution meteorological models combined with machine learning and prediction algorithms, Apple Weather provides current weather, 10-day hourly forecasts, daily forecasts, and historical weather.1WeatherKit is available to developers through both native Swift and REST APIs, and comes with 500,000 API calls per month included with an Apple Developer Program membership. Developers who need more will be able to purchase additional tiers of service right in the Apple Developer app starting this fall.
Developers can find more information on available plans for WeatherKithere.
Privacy-Focused Approach to Measuring Ads
The SKAdNetwork API comes with new features designed to help ad networks and advertisers better measure how ads perform in apps or on the web while still preserving user privacy. Hierarchical source IDs increase a developer’s ability to optimize their campaigns without increasing the risk of cross-app tracking of individuals. SKAdNetwork also features hierarchical conversion values to allow developers to receive more information about conversions for smaller campaigns, and developers can better calculate return on ad spend by offering multiple conversions at defined time windows.
New APIs for Even More Powerful Apps
Apple developers have more APIs available than ever to create app experiences that their users will love. Some of the latest APIs available to developers include:

PRESS RELEASE
watchOS 9 delivers new ways to stay connected, active, and healthy
Introducing more customizable watch faces, an enhanced Workout app, sleep stages, a first-of-its-kind AFib History feature, and an all-new Medications app
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewedwatchOS 9, which brings new features and enhanced experiences to the world’s leading wearable operating system. Apple Watch users will now have more watch faces to choose from, with richercomplications that provide more information and opportunity for personalization. In the updated Workout app, advanced metrics, views, and training experiences inspired by high-performing athletes help users take their workouts to the next level. watchOS 9 brings sleep stages to the Sleep app, and a new FDA-cleared AFib History feature provides deeper insights into a user’s condition. The new Medications app makes it easy for users to conveniently and discreetly manage, understand, and track medications.
“Users around the world love Apple Watch for helping them stay connected to those they love, be more active throughout the day, and better manage their health,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “This fall, watchOS 9 takes the Apple Watch experience to the next level with scientifically validated insights across fitness, sleep, and heart health, while providing users more creative ways to make their Apple Watch their own.”
Watch Faces for Everyone
The Apple Watch experience starts with watch faces, which give users the opportunity to express personal style while connecting them to relevant information at a glance through complications. watchOS 9 introduces four new faces: Lunar, which depicts the relationship between the Gregorian calendar and lunar calendar, used in many cultures such as Chinese, Islamic, and Hebrew; Playtime, a dynamic piece of art that’s unique to Apple Watch and created in collaboration with artist Joi Fulton; Metropolitan, a classic, type-driven watch face where the style changes as the Digital Crown is rotated; and Astronomy, an original face that has been completely remastered and features a new star map and current cloud data.
watchOS 9 introduces enhanced and modernized complications on some of the most classic watch faces, such as Utility, Simple, and Activity Analog, along with background color editing for Modular, Modular Compact, and X-Large for additional personalization. The new Portraits face showcases the depth effect on more photos, including cats, dogs, and landscapes, while Chinese scripts have been added as options for California and Typograph watch faces. Focus now allows users to select an Apple Watch face to automatically appear when they start a specific Focus on iPhone, such as the Photos face during a Personal Focus, helping users stay in the moment.
Workout App Updates
The Workout app, one of the most popular apps on Apple Watch, has been updated to provide richer metrics for measuring performance, as well as new training experiences to help users reach fitness goals. The familiar in-session display now uses the Digital Crown to rotate between easy-to-read Workout Views, so users can see important metrics for different training styles. Heart Rate Zones, which can be manually created or automatically calculated using personalized Health data, can be used to monitor the intensity of a workout. Interval training is an important part of any training plan, and in watchOS 9, the Workout app introduces Custom Workouts, which can be used to create a structured workout that can include work and rest intervals. New alerts, including pace, power, heart rate, and cadence, can be added to guide users throughout the workout.
For triathletes, the Workout app now supports a new Multisport workout type that automatically switches between any sequence of swimming, biking, and running workouts, using motion sensors to recognize movement patterns. When each workout is complete, a redesigned summary page in the Fitness app offers additional details with interactive charts for more precise analysis.
Hit the Ground Running
Apple Watch is already a powerful tool for runners, and watchOS 9 brings more data and features to help track how efficiently users run. New running form metrics, including Stride Length, Ground Contact Time, and Vertical Oscillation, can all be added as metrics on Workout Views. These metrics appear in the Fitness app summary and in the Health app, where users can see trends over time and learn from patterns.
Users can choose to race against their best or last result on frequently used routes, and receive alerts during the workout for being ahead or behind their pace, as well as when going off route. Additionally, a new pacer experience lets users choose a distance and goal for the time in which they want to complete a run, and calculates the pace required to achieve the goal. During the workout, they can follow the pace alerts and metrics provided.
Swimming Enhancements
Kickboard detection has been added as a new stroke type for Pool Swim workouts, using sensor fusion on Apple Watch to automatically detect when users are swimming with a kickboard and classify the stroke type in the workout summary along with distance swam. Swimmers can now track their efficiency with a SWOLF score — a stroke count combined with the time, in seconds, it takes to swim one length of the pool. Users can view their SWOLF average for each set in the workout summary.
Get More Out of Apple Fitness+ Workouts
Apple Fitness+ is the first fitness and wellness service built around Apple Watch, designed to be welcoming to all. It intelligently incorporates real-time workout metrics from Apple Watch right on the screen with iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, motivating users of all levels from start to finish. With watchOS 9, Fitness+ workouts now display on-screen guidance in addition to trainer coaching to help users get the most out of workouts, including: Intensity for HIIT, Cycling, Rowing, and Treadmill; Strokes per Minute (SPM) for Rowing; Revolutions per Minute (RPM) for Cycling; and Incline for walkers and runners in Treadmill.
Fitness+ subscribers without Apple TV can now use AirPlay to stream workouts and meditations with on-screen metrics to compatible third-party TVs and devices, allowing them to train anywhere, anytime.
Sleep Insights
The Sleep experience on Apple Watch already empowers users to create Wind Down and Bedtime schedules, as well as track their sleep to help them meet their goals. Sleep tracking in watchOS 9 provides even more insights with the introduction of sleep stages. Using signals from the accelerometer, Apple Watch can detect when users are in REM, Core, or Deep sleep. Users will see sleep stage data on Apple Watch in the Sleep app and can view more detailed information, like time asleep, alongside additional metrics, like heart rate and respiratory rate, in sleep comparison charts in the Health app on iPhone.
The machine learning models were trained and validated against the clinical gold standard, polysomnography, with one of the largest and most diverse populations ever studied for a wearable. As the science of sleep is still being explored, users will be able to aid in potential discoveries by contributing their sleep stage data in the Apple Heart and Movement Study through the Research app.
First-of-Its-Kind AFib History
Currently, the ECG app and irregular rhythm notification on Apple Watch can identify potential signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Left untreated, AFib is one of the leading conditions that can result in stroke.
Research suggests that the amount of time spent in AFib may impact a person’s symptoms, overall quality of life, and risk of complications. Previously, there has not been an easy way to track the frequency of AFib over an extended period of time, or to manage lifestyle factors that may influence one’s condition. According to the American Heart Association, addressing modifiable lifestyle factors may decrease the amount of time spent in AFib.1
With watchOS 9, users who are diagnosed with AFib can turn on the FDA-cleared AFib History feature2and access important information, including an estimate of how frequently a user’s heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, providing deeper insights into their condition. Users will also receive weekly notifications to understand frequency and view a detailed history in the Health app, including lifestyle factors that may influence AFib, like sleep, alcohol consumption, and exercise.
Users can download a PDF with a detailed history of their AFib and lifestyle factors, which can easily be shared with doctors and care providers for more informed conversations.
Medications
The new Medications experience on Apple Watch and iPhone helps users manage and track their medications, vitamins, and supplements, allowing them to create a medications list, set up schedules and reminders, and view information on their medications in the Health app. The Medications app on Apple Watch makes it easy for users to conveniently and discreetly track medications anytime, anywhere.
Custom schedules can be created for each medication, whether it needs to be taken multiple times a day, once a week, or as needed, and users can set up reminders to help keep them on track. In the US, users can receive an alert if there are potential critical interactions with medications they have added to the Health app.3
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s iPhone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers.
Additional watchOS 9 Updates
Availability
The developer beta of watchOS 9 is available to Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today. A public beta will be available to watchOS users next month atbeta.apple.com. watchOS 9 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 4 or later paired with iPhone 8 or later and iPhone SE (second generation) or later, running iOS 16.

UPDATE
Apple expands industry-leading commitment to protect users from highly targeted mercenary spyware
Apple is previewing a groundbreaking security capability that offers specialized additional protection to users who may be at risk of highly targeted cyberattacks from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Apple is also providing details of its $10 million grant to bolster research exposing such threats.
Apple today detailed two initiatives to help protect users who may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Lockdown Mode — the first major capability of its kind, coming this fall with iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura — is an extreme, optional protection for the very small number of users who face grave, targeted threats to their digital security. Apple also shared details about the $10 million cybersecurity grant it announced last November to support civil society organizations that conduct mercenary spyware threat research and advocacy.
“Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market. Lockdown Mode is a groundbreaking capability that reflects our unwavering commitment to protecting users from even the rarest, most sophisticated attacks,” said Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture. “While the vast majority of users will never be the victims of highly targeted cyberattacks, we will work tirelessly to protect the small number of users who are. That includes continuing to design defenses specifically for these users, as well as supporting researchers and organizations around the world doing critically important work in exposing mercenary companies that create these digital attacks.”
Lockdown Mode offers an extreme, optional level of security for the very few users who, because of who they are or what they do, may be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats, such as those from NSO Group and other private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. Turning on Lockdown Mode in iOS 16, iPadOS 16, and macOS Ventura further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface that potentially could be exploited by highly targeted mercenary spyware.
At launch, Lockdown Mode includes the following protections:
Apple will continue to strengthen Lockdown Mode and add new protections to it over time. To invite feedback and collaboration from the security research community, Apple has also established a new category within the Apple Security Bounty program to reward researchers who find Lockdown Mode bypasses and help improve its protections. Bounties are doubled for qualifying findings in Lockdown Mode, up to a maximum of $2,000,000 — the highest maximum bounty payout in the industry.
Apple is also making a $10 million grant, in addition to any damages awarded from the lawsuit filed against NSO Group, to support organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks, including those created by private companies developing state-sponsored mercenary spyware. The grant will be made to theDignity and Justice Fundestablished and advised by the Ford Foundation — a private foundation dedicated to advancing equity worldwide — and designed to pool philanthropic resources to advance social justice globally. The Dignity and Justice Fund is a fiscally sponsored project of the New Venture Fund, a 501(c)(3) public charity.
“The global spyware trade targets human rights defenders, journalists, and dissidents; it facilitates violence, reinforces authoritarianism, and supports political repression,” said Lori McGlinchey, the Ford Foundation’s director of its Technology and Society program. “The Ford Foundation is proud to support this extraordinary initiative to bolster civil society research and advocacy to resist mercenary spyware. We must build on Apple’s commitment, and we invite companies and donors to join the Dignity and Justice Fund and bring additional resources to this collective fight.”
The Dignity and Justice Fund expects to make its first grants in late 2022 or early 2023, initially funding approaches to help expose mercenary spyware and protect potential targets that include:
The Dignity and Justice Fund’s grant-making strategy to research, track, and hold the enhanced cyber weapons trade accountable will be advised by an independent, global Technical Advisory Committee. Initial members include:
“There is now undeniable evidence from the research of the Citizen Lab and other organizations that the mercenary surveillance industry is facilitating the spread of authoritarian practices and massive human rights abuses worldwide,” said Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto. “I applaud Apple for establishing this important grant, which will send a strong message and help nurture independent researchers and advocacy organizations holding mercenary spyware vendors accountable for the harms they are inflicting on innocent people.”

Terry, Janina Gavankar, Tom Irwin, and Marcia Gay Harden, as well as new additions for season two Greta Lee, Ruairi O’Connor, Hasan Minhaj, Holland Taylor, Tara Karsian as news producer Gayle Burns, Valeria Golino, and Julianna Margulies.

“Schmigadoon!”
A parody of iconic musicals, “Schmigadoon!” is a new musical comedy series starring Emmy Award nominee Cecily Strong and Emmy Award winner Keegan-Michael Key as a couple on a backpacking trip designed to reinvigorate their relationship when they discover a magical town in which everyone is living in a studio musical from the 1940s. They then discover that they can’t leave until they find “true love.”

But when a Trivantian scientist develops a new and devastating form of sighted weaponry that threatens the future of humanity, Baba returns to Paya in order to protect his tribe once more.
“See” is executive produced by Steven Knight, Francis Lawrence, Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, Jim Rowe, Jennifer Yale, Anders Engström, and Jonathan Tropper, who also serves as showrunner. The series is produced by Chernin Entertainment and Endeavor Content.
“Severance”
In “Severance,” Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.
“Severance” is written and created by Dan Erickson. Mark Friedman, Chris Black, John Cameron, and Andrew Colville are executive producers alongside Erickson. Ben Stiller, Nicky Weinstock, and Jackie Cohn executive produce through Red Hour Productions, and both Patricia Arquette and Adam Scott serve as producers. Endeavor Content serves as the studio.
“Ted Lasso”
Jason Sudeikis is Ted Lasso, an American football coach hired to manage a British soccer team — despite having no experience. But what he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for with optimism, underdog determination — and biscuits. The widely acclaimed series also stars Hannah Waddingham, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Brett Goldstein, Phil Dunster, and Nick Mohammed.
In addition to starring, Sudeikis serves as executive producer, alongside Bill Lawrence via his Doozer Productions, in association with Warner Bros. and Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group. Doozer’s Jeff Ingold also serves as an executive producer, with Liza Katzer as co-executive producer. The series was developed by Sudeikis, Lawrence, Brendan Hunt, and Joe Kelly, and is based on the preexisting format and characters from NBC Sports.
“They Call Me Magic”
“They Call Me Magic” offers a rare glimpse into the incredible real-life story of Earvin “Magic” Johnson, who left his mark on history through his work — both on and off the court — and continues to impact our culture today. With unprecedented access, the docuseries explores Magic’s remarkable journey from being the face of the Los Angeles Lakers and cementing himself as an all-time NBA legend, to changing the conversation around HIV, and transforming into a successful entrepreneur and community activist. From Magic’s humble beginnings in Lansing, Michigan, to becoming the global force he is today, “They Call Me Magic” charts the cinematic life of one of the biggest cultural icons. The highly anticipated documentary event series explores the remarkable accomplishments and global impact of Johnson’s life, both on and off the court.
Directed by Rick Famuyiwa (“Dope”) and cinematographer Rachel Morrison (“Black Panther”), the docuseries is produced for Apple by XTR and New Slate Ventures, and produced in association with h.wood Media and Delirio Films.

UPDATE
Apple introduces Apple Music Sessions
Exclusive live releases from Carrie Underwood and Tenille Townes are available now, only on Apple Music
Today, Apple Music is premiering Apple Music Sessions, exclusive live releases featuring some of the world’s most prolific artists and emerging artists, all in Spatial Audio. Recorded out of Apple Music’s studios around the world, Apple Music Sessions gives artists the opportunity to reimagine and recreate hits from their catalog, and creative covers of beloved classics. These unique performances are also filmed, resulting in a special, bespoke live collection comprised of brand-new Spatial Audio tracks and companion live performance music videos that will all be available exclusively to Apple Music fans worldwide.
Apple Music Sessions officially launches today with releases from Carrie Underwood and Tenille Townes, recorded out of Apple Music’s new state-of-the-art studios in Nashville, Tennessee.
During her session, Underwood performed her hit “Ghost Story,” as well as a stripped-back version of “Blown Away,” and a cover of Ozzy Osbourne’s “Mama, I’m Coming Home.”
“Being in the studio with Apple Music was such an incredible experience, and I’m excited to share these unique, stripped-down versions of three songs I love with my fans,” Underwood said. “We had a lot of fun reimagining these big, visual songs and presenting them in a different way.”
“I have always been an Ozzy Osbourne fan and ‘Mama, I’m Coming Home’ is one of my all-time favorite songs,” Underwood continued. “I’ve always thought it felt a lot like a country song, and I’ve wanted to cover it for a long time. This was a really fun opportunity for me to be able to finally make that happen. I hope we’ve done Ozzy proud and I hope he likes it.”
“Carrie Underwood: Apple Music Sessions - EP”
Country singer-songwriter Tenille Townes performed her hits “Same Road Home” and “Somebody’s Daughter,” as well as a gritty, soulful cover of Etta James’s “At Last.”
“It was so cool capturing the spirit of how it feels to play my songs live with my band during the Apple Music Sessions performance,” Townes said. “The new space feels like it’s going to become an anchor for our music community in Nashville, and it was an honor to be a part of breaking it in.”
“I chose ‘Same Road Home’ because I really love the message in the song of us all being more alike as humans than we often realize,” she continued. “‘Somebody’s Daughter’ is one of those songs that has grown with us as a band for the past couple of years, and it was really fun to showcase our live version of it. And ‘At Last’ is a song that sets the bar to me as a writer and a singer. I’ve never recorded a version of it before, and I loved getting to include it in my Apple Music Sessions.”
“Tenille Townes: Apple Music Sessions - EP”
Apple Music Sessions kicks off in Nashville with a host of incredible country artists already lined up, including Ronnie Dunn, Ingrid Andress, and many others, and Apple also plans to expand the series into other genres of music in the future.

UPDATE
How Apple is empowering people with their health information
A new report shares the ways Apple products are helping users, developers, and health organizations advance personal health, research, and care
Today Apple shareda new reportthat offers a snapshot of the ways Apple products are empowering people to be at the center of their health, and acting as an intelligent guardian for their health and safety. Users, developers, medical institutions, and health organizations around the world are using Apple devices, features, and APIs to break down barriers between people and their health information, all while keeping privacy in mind.
Apple’s efforts to advance health primarily fall into two categories, which are detailed in two corresponding sections of the report. The first section describes Apple’s focus on personal health and fitness features on Apple Watch and iPhone that offer actionable, science-based insights and help protect users’ health and safety. The second section shares Apple’s work with the medical community to support research and care. Both sections — along with an Extensions and Spotlights section at the report’s end — include a variety of examples of third-party developers, health institutions, and organizations innovating with Apple technology.
“We believe passionately that technology can play a role in improving health outcomes and encouraging people to live a healthier day, and we are excited about the many ways users are benefiting from our health and fitness features, and by the ways third-party developers, institutions, and organizations are using Apple technology to advance health and science,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Our vision for the future is to continue to create science-based technology that equips people with even more information and acts as an intelligent guardian for their health, so they’re no longer passengers on their own health journey. Instead, we want people to be firmly in the driver’s seat with meaningful, actionable insights.”
Empowering Users on Their Personal Health Journeys
Since the release of the Health app in 2014 and Apple Watch in 2015, Apple has introduced a wide array of innovative health and fitness features, with the goal to provide users with easy-to-understand, meaningful insights so they can be empowered to live a healthier life. The report outlines the four pillars of Apple’s health and fitness features: 1) giving users a central and secure place to store and view their health data in the Health app, 2) offering features that enable Apple Watch to act as an intelligent guardian for users’ health, 3) offering features that help users improve their everyday health and fitness for better health outcomes, and 4) fueling innovative third-party health and fitness apps with developer tools.
With the release of iOS 16 and watchOS 9 this fall, Apple Watch and iPhone will offer features that focus on 17 areas of health and fitness, from heart health and sleep to mobility and women’s health, and more. Over the years, customers of all ages have shared how these health and fitness features have, in their own words, changed their lives. Several share their stories in the report, including customers who have discovered serious heart conditions, received emergency assistance after a fall, or dramatically improved their health through daily activity.
Users can now store over 150 different types of health data from Apple Watch, iPhone, and connected third-party apps and devices in one central view in the Health app, in addition to available health records data from connected institutions in the US, UK, and Canada. There are now tens of thousands of apps on the App Store that use the HealthKit API, which allows developers to incorporate data users choose to share from the Health app to offer innovative health and fitness experiences, with rigorous privacy and data security protocols. The report spotlights examples of globally popular HealthKit-enabled apps like Nike Run Club, Calm, and WeightWatchers, plus an increasing number of HealthKit-enabled apps — including Qardio heart health and Withings Health Mate — that use connected accessories to allow users to track and monitor even more aspects of their health.
Supporting the Health Ecosystem by Collaborating with the Medical Community
Apple believes the strongest health innovations are possible only through direct collaboration with the medical community, and the report describes four categories of this collaboration: 1) building tools to enable researchers to make new scientific discoveries, 2) helping strengthen the physician-patient relationship with meaningful data, 3) collaborating with health organizations to promote healthy lifestyles at large scale, and 4) supporting public health and government initiatives.
The ResearchKit framework gives researchers the opportunity to recruit study participants from a large user base of iPhone and Apple Watch users, and for participants to choose to share health data to help advance science. Through the Research app, Apple has collaborated with Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the American Heart Association, and the University of Michigan and World Health Organization to offer users across the US the opportunity to participate in three first-of-their-kind research studies: the Apple Women’s Health Study, the Apple Heart and Movement Study, and the Apple Hearing Study. Early learnings from the studies appear in the report, as well as information on other studies Apple has supported, like the Heart Failure Study with University Health Network and the Digital Mental Health Study with UCLA.
Health Records on iPhone in the Health app, along with apps and devices developed by third parties using Apple developer tools, help strengthen physician-patient relationships with meaningful data. Health Records is now available to patients at over 800 institutions across over 12,000 locations, making it easy for patients to see their available medical data from multiple providers in the Health app whenever they choose. Research has shown that connecting patients with their care teams remotely results in better outcomes with the Corrie Health app, UVA Health care at home programs, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs loaning Apple devices to veterans to connect them with their VA healthcare services. Care teams are better able to help patients with chronic conditions at Ochsner Health System and NHS Sunderland, and remote monitoring is reducing the cost and length of stays in the neonatal intensive care units at Odense University Hospital and the University of Virginia Children’s Hospital, where premature babies can come home with their parents but stay connected to care teams remotely.
Health organizations and companies around the world — including Paceline in the US; Vitality Active Rewards in the US, the UK, South Africa, and Australia; and LumiHealth in Singapore — have collaborated with Apple to integrate Apple Watch into their wellness programs. There are currently 55 programs running in 17 countries with over a million users taking part in an incentive program leveraging Apple Watch. These programs have been successful in increasing participants’ physical activity levels and uptake of health behaviors, such as aiming for more regular sleep patterns, focusing on mindfulness, and swapping in healthier food options.
Finally, the report highlights Apple’s partnerships with clinicians and local governments on unique ways to support their crucial work to promote public health, including building apps and features during the COVID-19 health crisis.
Grounded in Science and Designed Around Privacy
All of Apple’s health and fitness features have been developed with two overarching principles:

Outside of them, there isn’t much for people who don’t have a steady income or access to family resources — it’s heartbreaking. But I’m so happy to be a part of this and to help our residents begin again.

Apple partnerships are helping build new homes and new starts in communities across California
At the recently opened Veterans Square housing complex in Pittsburg, California, a new community is blossoming. It’s not uncommon to see residents like J.C. in the hall, serenading one of his neighbors with a gospel song, or to find Tonia in the backyard, plotting out a new herb garden.
At the center of it all is Marcus Ferdinand, 39, the building’s service coordinator. But his role is much more than that — he is a counselor and friend to the residents at the complex, making sure they are cared for and adjusting to their new surroundings. For the vast majority, it is a world away from the streets they recently called home.
Veterans Square is a 30-unit building for both veterans and individuals who have been identified as having the greatest need for housing. It was opened in March, with funding from donors including Apple, as part of the company’s $2.5 billion commitment to address the housing crisis across California. Apple has now deployed more than $1.3 billion of that commitment to a diverse array of projects in conjunction with California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), Destination: Home, and Housing Trust Silicon Valley.
“We’re incredibly proud to see families and neighbors moving into new homes as a result of our partnership with affordable housing organizations across California,” said Kristina Raspe, Apple’s vice president for Global Real Estate and Facilities. “Apple is committed to finding real solutions that can help our communities thrive, and these new projects represent tangible progress toward making that promise a reality for so many of our fellow Californians.”
In partnership with CalHFA, Apple has provided mortgage and down payment assistance to thousands of low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers, and launched an affordable housing investment program that has unlocked funding to support nearly 2,000 units across the state. They include 315 units at Avenue 34 in Los Angeles, almost 340 units at Redwood Gardens in Berkeley, and more than 230 units for families in Chico’s Cedar Village, including for those impacted by the 2018 Camp Fire.
Destination: Home works to end homelessness in Silicon Valley, and Apple’s support has helped the nonprofit expand its Homelessness Prevention System, which has provided financial and rental assistance to more than 20,000 families during the COVID-19 pandemic. Apple’s support has also helped Destination: Home fund nearly 1,700 units of supportive and extremely low-income housing in the Bay Area, and extend Wi-Fi to several housing communities.
The Veterans Square building was made possible through Apple’s partnership with Housing Trust Silicon Valley, a community development financial institution (CDFI) that provides early capital to developers of affordable housing. Together, Apple and Housing Trust Silicon Valley have provided funding to support 10 affordable housing projects across the Bay Area, including in San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and beyond, with more projects on the horizon.
At Veterans Square, J.C. is one of the 20 veterans who now call the building home. The 85-year-old spent 20 years in the Navy as an aircraft mechanic. Most recently, he was living with a family friend, but that arrangement was coming to an end.
“I didn’t know if I was going to get in, so I prayed about it,” J.C. says. “I love my apartment. They even put me on the first floor because it’s easier with my walker. That meant a lot to me.”
J.C. talks to everyone he sees in the halls and in the back garden, reserving his best jokes and quips for Ferdinand.
“Marcus is a good fella,” J.C. says. It’s a sentiment echoed by many at Veterans Square.
Ferdinand is a veteran himself, having served in the Air Force, and can connect with many residents because of that shared experience. After leaving the military, Ferdinand went on to get his graduate degree in social work.
“I remember growing up in a community where there were a lot of problems,” Ferdinand says. “I just never thought it was the way life should be for people. I feel like everyone has the potential to lead a life that they enjoy — and for some of us, it’s just harder to get there. And so if I can help someone to get to that point, it makes it all worthwhile.”
Two years ago, Ferdinand was hired by Satellite Affordable Housing Associates, which developed, owns, and manages Veterans Square — and provides onsite services for residents.
“It’s a brand-new building, so it’s an opportunity for me to really help from the ground up,” he says. “A lot of that is building a community with the residents — introducing them to each other, having different events, and just talking to people and helping them work through the different struggles that they may have with being housed.”
That help includes services provided though the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as sessions with social workers, therapists, and financial counselors.
“Partnerships like this one with Apple are vital,” Ferdinand says. “Outside of them, there isn’t much for people who don’t have a steady income or access to family resources — it’s heartbreaking. But I’m so happy to be a part of this and to help our residents begin again.”
Before she moved into Veterans Square in March, Tonia, 60, was living in a hotel as part of a program to help those waiting for housing stay off the streets. Now she has a one-bedroom apartment she has filled with plants and photos of her family.
“It’s home,” she says, looking around with pride. “I have neighbors, and we look out for each other — I have a friend here who will come with me to get groceries and help me carry them back. And Marcus is amazing.”
Ferdinand is helping Tonia with paperwork to access transportation to take her to medical appointments, and to a variety of other services that are available through the building. She’s also going to start a Bible study group with J.C., and has a plan for the building’s outdoor common area.
“I’m excited to start my little garden downstairs,” says Tonia, pulling out seed packages. “I have basil, cilantro, chives, and parsley — and doing that is going to help me out a lot.”
That belief in a better tomorrow for this new community is what drives Ferdinand every day.
“I hope that this place can become the home that they imagined when they were out on the street,” he says. “A place where they can be happy, where they can feel fulfilled, and where they can have some agency over what’s happening and really enjoy their lives.”

The new London store offers advancements in sustainable design, community events and resources, and a team of more than 200 ready to provide excellent service for customers
LONDONApple today previewed Apple Brompton Road, its newest store in London, located in the city’s bustling Knightsbridge neighborhood. A stone’s throw from Hyde Park, Apple Brompton Road features design inspiration drawn from local flora, along with a new slate of community events and seminars to help customers learn, create, and get the most out of their Apple products.
“We are thrilled to open Apple Brompton Road in London, a city teeming with energy, history, and cultural diversity,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “The store’s focus on creativity gives our incredible team members the perfect space to share their passion and expertise with Londoners and visitors from around the world.”
Special Sessions
The store opening kicks off with the global launch of “United Visions,” an augmented reality experience honoring the creative works of pioneering London poet and painter William Blake. Created for Getty Museum and brought to life through Apple technology, the purpose-built app showcases the possibilities of creativity by reimagining the seminal artist’s work. Artists and creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Ed Cutting (Tin&Ed) used Apple’s M1 Ultra chip in the development of the experience, which features a poetic soundtrack by Grammy Award-winning record producer Just Blaze. “United Visions” can be viewed by customers in-store and by anyone around the world by downloading the“United Visions” app.
Opening weekend festivities will include a panel discussion on the creation of “United Visions” with Nguyen, Cutting, and Just Blaze, as well as a special performance and Spatial Audio listening session by London artist Nina Nesbitt. Apple Fitness+ trainers Cory Wharton-Malcolm, Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, Kim Ngo, and Jonelle Lewis will join Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of Fitness Technologies, for an in-store Q&A followed by a 3-kilometer walk and 5-kilometer run in Hyde Park. The talented Apple Creative Pros will also host live illustration sessions that take inspiration from the local blooms.
Following the opening sessions, the store will host its ongoing Brompton Series, which takes place on the last Thursday of every month through October and features:
The Store and Team
Upon entering Apple Brompton Road, visitors will be greeted by 12 towering Sicilian ficus trees that line the 7-meter floor-to-ceiling windows and entryway. The seating at the base of each planter acts as a social gathering space for visitors, blurring the boundaries between inside and outside, and bringing nature directly into the store. Visitors come through the central arcade, which mirrors the dimensions of the original Brompton Arcade built on the same precise location in 1903. The store’s Forum — where free Today at Apple sessions provide daily creative inspiration and practical skills — features a first for Apple in the UK: a mirrored ceiling that offers depth-enhancing reflections.
Visitors are invited to explore the surrounding display tables and avenues featuring the all-new lineup of iPhone, Mac, iPad, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, as well as accessories like HomePod mini and AirTag. The 200-person store team helps customers learn about Apple products, and offers advice on monthly financing options and the Apple Trade In program. Collectively speaking more than 45 languages, the team is ready to welcome customers from around the world. And in another first for the UK, a dedicated Apple Pickup area makes it even more convenient for customers to pick up products ordered online.
Sustainability
Apple Brompton Road’s terrazzo flooring is comprised of a plant-based bio polymers, the first of its kind in Apple’s worldwide retail fleet. The vast space — which features a unique curved timber ceiling — offers ample seating where customers can relax and discover new tips and tricks to get the best from their devices. Like all Apple facilities, Apple Brompton Road is powered by 100 percent renewable energy.
Apple in the UK
For nearly 40 years, Apple has been operating in the UK, where it has more than 6,000 team members. Across the country, Apple supports over 450,000 jobs through the thriving iOS app economy, work with suppliers, and direct employment. Apple Brompton Road opens Thursday, July 28, at 4 p.m. BST in London. Customers are encouraged to download interactive custom wallpapers, listen to a curatedApple Music Brompton Road Playlist, and sign up for upcomingToday at Apple sessions.

2022-08-18,Increase,Seeing Chicago differently with iPhone and iPad,"I like when pictures tell a story. This program is a nice starting point for writing actual scripts because I’m learning [how] to actually portray visuals.
Adetokunbo “Toks” Opeifa
Text of this article
August 18, 2022
FEATURE
Seeing Chicago differently with iPhone and iPad
Participants of The Chicago Lighthouse’s Photography for All program gain independence, confidence, and creative skills
Adetokunbo “Toks” Opeifa loves exploring Chicago. She travels the city unconcerned about losing track of a planned route, immersing herself in her environment and capturing photos of her surroundings with her iPhone. “Chicago is a grid system,” she explains. “Even if you get lost, you don’t really get lost, you just walk in the opposite direction and you’ll end up somewhere.”
In the first grade, Opeifa, now 18, was diagnosed with cone-rod dystrophy, a retinal disorder that causes progressive vision loss and light sensitivity. This year, she is participating in Photography for All, a program for youth who have low vision or are legally blind, launched by nonprofit The Chicago Lighthouse in partnership with the city of Chicago’s Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS) and Apple. Over the course of the six-week program, participants have learned technical photography, coding, and career-readiness skills, but most importantly, they’ve gained tools to help them navigate the world around them independently and confidently.
Photography for All is part of the city’s One Summer Chicago youth employment initiative, which provides people ages 14 to 24 with internships and job opportunities at government institutions, community-based organizations, and companies throughout the city. Since 2017, Apple has supported the city’s One Summer Chicago program through its Community Education Initiative, helping create opportunities for youth to develop new skills with Everyone Can Create and Everyone Can Code guides. This summer, more than 200 students experienced opportunities in photography, videography, game design, coding, app development, augmented reality, and more through Apple-supported programs.
The Chicago Lighthouse provided each of the Photography for All participants with an iPad Air, Apple Pencil, and Magic Keyboard to support their creativity. The iPad setup offered an expansive screen with tools to shoot, edit, and share their work. Many participants, including Opeifa, also used their own iPhone to capture photos on the go, seamlessly switching between devices depending on their needs.
Apple experts trained the students on using the camera and photography settings they would need, as well as the accessibility features built into the devices — including VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, and Zoom, which magnifies on-screen elements. For those using VoiceOver on iPhone and iPad, Image Descriptions available in the Camera app uses on-device machine learning to help position a subject and describe the objects, setting, and people in the field of view.
While visiting the Adler Planetarium and the surrounding Northerly Island Park for a final day of shooting, Opeifa double-taps her iPhone screen with three fingers in the Camera app to zoom in on the subject of her photo. “Before I discovered Zoom, I’d just hold my phone up all the way to my face,” she says. “This way I can actually see better.”
Opeifa has been using Apple technology since she was in kindergarten when her parents purchased the first-generation iPad to help her read her schoolwork digitally. She laughs at a memory of herself running around her family’s home in Nigeria a few years later with an iPad mini, excited to add to her collection of Apple devices. Having spent much of her life using Apple technology, she is comfortable using her iPhone to get a better view of the world, and she’s also learning how to edit her photographs on iPad. Whether she’s navigating from one corner of the city to the next, or capturing flowers, the city skyline, and any other snapshots of urban life around her that pique her interest, Opeifa is hooked on visual storytelling.
“I like when pictures tell a story,” Opeifa says. “This program is a nice starting point for writing actual scripts because I’m learning [how] to actually portray visuals.”
Opeifa prefers film and television as a visual medium to bring her stories to life, and she sees photo editing as a way to hone her screenwriting skills. “Screenwriting and editing photos are kind of the same thing — especially working with other people who are blind, you have to be very descriptive,” she explains.
“I never get to see myself represented in television as a Black woman who is also a visually impaired, legally blind individual,” adds Opeifa, who is heading to California this month to attend Chapman University to pursue screenwriting. “Television is a way for people to see themselves in different lights and different identities.”
Opeifa is just one of several Photography for All participants with bold, big ideas for their future. Lance Gladney, who is passionate about pursuing a career in art, hopes to produce his own anime franchise. Gladney joined the program to experiment with a new form of visual art. John Johnson — participating in the program for a second year — is interested in electrical engineering or game design. And Alaula “Aihua” Sprecher is considering colleges where she can study computer science, physics, and astronomy.
Shelle Hamer, The Chicago Lighthouse’s director of youth transition, and Lisa Davis, the former director of One Summer Chicago who brought the idea for Photography for All to The Lighthouse, are excited about the growth every participant experiences.
“Confidence and self-esteem are hard — or I thought would be hard — to zoom in and teach,” says Davis, who also served as director of youth employment at DFSS before she retired. “But this program helped them open up and expose their confidence. It takes away the idea that they can’t do this.”
An artist herself, Hamer has enjoyed a four-decade career equipping individuals with disabilities with tools and education to help them lead more independent lives. When she and Davis launched Photography for All four years ago, she was intrigued by the prospect of how people see differently and express themselves creatively — and saw an opportunity to use Apple technology and Everyone Can Create resources to support that work.
“The tool of photography has a real benefit to people with vision loss,” Hamer says, “from both the artistic side and the functional. All of the kids feel that they have expanded their ability to feel that they can travel anywhere, go to places they’ve never been before. The training they received on the accessibility features available on their iPhone and iPad has given them the confidence to navigate the city and feel independent in traveling around unfamiliar areas on their own.”
And that’s the overarching goal of the program, after all: supporting youth in their quest to be independent and instilling in them the confidence to take their future into their own hands. “It’s just opened the world for them,” Hamer says.

2022-08-19,Decrease,Shazam turns 20,"Text of this article
August 19, 2022
UPDATE
Shazam turns 20
Shazam turns 20 today, and as of this week, it has officially surpassed 70 billion song recognitions. A mainstay in popular culture, the platform has changed the way people engage with music by making song identification accessible to everyone. For more than 225 million global monthly users, to “Shazam” is to discover something new.
To mark the occasion, Shazam invites fans to take a trip down memory lane with a special playlist comprised of the most Shazamed song of each calendar year for the past 20 years. Featuring everything from Train’s “Hey, Soul Sister” to Sia’s “Cheap Thrills,” the playlist is a true reflection of the music fans across the globe actively searched for over the past two decades. Listen now exclusively on Apple Music.
Over the years, Shazam’s global charts have played a crucial role in helping to identify breaking new talent like Masked Wolf, who was one of Shazam’s 5 Artists to Watch in 2021 and ended up having the most Shazamed track globally that year with “Astronaut In The Ocean.”
“The fact that people all over the world took time out of their day to pull out their phone and Shazam my songs is a huge honor for me as an artist,” said Masked Wolf. “You know you’ve got something special if you see the Shazam stats moving.”
Shazam’s charts have also become a barometer for unexpected pop culture moments. Kate Bush’s 1985 song “Running Up That Hill” being featured in “Stranger Things” led to an all-time peak in Shazams of the singer, and the track took No. 1 on the Shazam Global Top 200 for 10 days. It ended up reaching the top of 25 national charts — more than any other song in 2022.
Keeping its finger on the pulse of music, Shazam has also played a key role in bringing local artists to a global audience. The longest-running global No. 1 song of 2021 was “Love Nwantiti [Remix]” by Nigerian artist CKay, which became the second song to ever surpass one million Shazams in a week.
“Shazam has played an impactful role in my career,” said CKay. “It allowed millions of people all over the world to discover me and my unique Nigerian sound. It made me a global sensation even before I started to perform all over the world. The story of CKay cannot be told without Shazam connecting me to the world.”
With its continued commitment to innovation over the past two decades, Shazam is pioneering new ways to bring fans closer to the music and artists they love with new tools like the concert discovery feature, which spotlights concert information and tickets on sale for shows nearby, simply by Shazaming a song, or by searching for it in the Shazam app or website.
While Shazam remains focused on the future of music discovery, today’s anniversary offers an opportunity to look back at the notable moments and milestones that make up its two-decade history.

UPDATE
Apple celebrates America’s parks
Through August 28, Apple is donating $10 to the National Park Foundation for every Apple Pay purchase on apple.com, in the Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store in the US
Celebrating 106 years of the US National Park Service, Apple today introduced more ways to learn about and support America’s parks. These offerings include a $10 donation the company will make to the National Park Foundation for every Apple Pay purchase made with Apple through August 28,1along with special content and collections on Apple Maps, Apple Podcasts, and more.
“Whenever I visit our national parks — as I did recently in Yosemite and Glacier — I feel the sense of awe, tranquility, and quiet reverence only nature can inspire,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re proud to partner with the organizations and communities who maintain our parks, educate us about their history, and share them with the world. These treasures are well worth protecting, today and for every generation to come.”
Last year, Apple’s support for the National Park Foundation helped young people from across the country — like Kalen Anderson, 2022 Corps Member of the Year — participate in a service corps program at a national park. This year, Anderson completed the Werowocomoco internship program at Colonial National Historical Park and Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail through the Appalachian Conservation Corps. As part of the program formed in partnership with the National Park Foundation, he was able to engage directly in the management of a Native archeological site that is part of his Indigenous identity and heritage.
“Of my time as a corps member and intern of the National Park Service, I have been given an opportunity that has influenced how I developed and continue to develop myself as a steward,” said Anderson, who is a member of the Nansemond Indian Nation. “I have learned that I am not only a steward of my environment, but also of my culture. The profound time I have spent working with the team around me will forever have a positive impression on who I strive to become for myself and for my community.”
With a passion for park preservation and an understanding of its impact on his culture, Anderson joins a collective of Indigenous service corps members who represent the next generation of national park stewards. Apple’s donation to the National Park Foundation last year, driven by customer purchases made with Apple Pay, also benefited the Leaders of Color service corps crew, which provides a supportive space for aspiring BIPOC conservationists to break into the field. This support aligns with the company’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, a long-term effort to address systemic racism and expand opportunities for Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities.
“America’s national parks are a gift we share,” said Will Shafroth, the National Park Foundation’s president and CEO. “Apple’s partnership and generous commitment help to ensure that all people see themselves in national parks and feel welcome in these places that belong to all of us.”
In addition to supporting these and other programs operating to preserve America’s cherished national parks through Apple Pay purchases this week, Apple customers can also enjoy the unique worlds of these parks through special collections and offerings across Apple services.
TheParks that Honor Native American HistoryGuide in Apple Maps allows users to learn more about national parks celebrating Indigenous history and heritage. On Apple Podcasts, listeners can check out acollection of episodescentering Indigenous voices, including the“Yellowstone” episode of “Parks,”a podcast about the people who lived on US public lands before colonists arrived.
Apple Watch users are encouraged to celebrate the beauty of national parks everywhere with a limited edition Activity Challenge award. On August 27, users can earn the award by completing a hike, walk, run, or wheelchair workout of a mile or more.

UPDATE
Apple expands Self Service Repair to Mac notebooks
Genuine Apple parts and tools can be purchased by US customers on August 23
Apple announced Self Service Repair will be available tomorrow for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks with the M1 family of chips, providing repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools through the AppleSelf Service Repair Store. Self Service Repair for iPhone launched earlier this year and the program will expand to additional countries — beginning in Europe — as well as additional Mac models later this year.
Self Service Repair for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro offers more than a dozen different repair types for each model, including the display, top case with battery, and trackpad, with more to come. Customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices will be able to complete repairs on these Mac notebooks, with access to many of the same parts and tools available to Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers.
To start the Self Service Repair process, a customer will first review the repair manual for the product they want to repair by visitingsupport.apple.com/self-service-repair. Then, they can visit the Apple Self Service Repair Store and order the necessary parts and tools.
Every genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. Customers can send replaced parts back to Apple for refurbishment and recycling, and in many cases receive credit of their purchase by doing so.
The Apple tools are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. Apple will offer rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. Customers will have access to the tool kit for one week and it will be shipped free of charge.
Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.
Over the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 3,500 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, in the US, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 20 minutes of an authorized service provider.

UPDATE
Apple propels environmental business solutions forward with second Impact Accelerator class
These trailblazing leaders from across the US are helping speed the transition to a green economy
Apple today introduced its second Impact Accelerator class — a cohort of 16 Black-, Hispanic/Latinx-, and Indigenous-owned businesses working on the cutting edge of environmental services and solutions. Part of the company’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, the Impact Accelerator will provide training and mentorship to help propel the selected businesses toward the next stage of growth while advancing a shared goal of creating a greener world.
“The fight to address climate change demands that we band together to develop innovative solutions while empowering and uplifting the communities we’re working to protect,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We are thrilled for this dynamic group of innovators to take their important work to the next level with help from our Impact Accelerator, and we are proud to deepen our commitment to working with partners around the country to ensure that environmental progress and equity go hand in hand.”
The companies will participate in a three-month program aimed at accelerating progress toward their goals. Executives and their teams will receive customized training that provides the knowledge and tools needed to succeed as an Apple supplier, access to Apple mentors and experts to help align business priorities with environmental goals, and scholarship opportunities with leading executive education programs focused on supply chain and growth.
Following the program, the companies will be considered for business opportunities with Apple as it works to achieve carbon neutrality across its entire manufacturing supply chain by 2030. Apple has been carbon neutral for its corporate operations since 2020.
The Impact Accelerator program launched last year with the goal of ensuring that the company’s strategic work and investments to protect the environment also help expand access to opportunity for communities of color. Since their participation in the program, companies in the inaugural Impact Accelerator class have seen increased recognition for their work within their sector and local communities, built connections with public- and private-sector leaders advancing climate-based solutions at the local and state levels, and seen their overall business opportunities expand. Several are currently working with Apple as part of the company’s supply chain network, and every company has participated in selective opportunities to be assessed for potential business with Apple.
Meet the Companies
From creating the world’s largest water database to developing clean energy projects on tribal lands to helping farmers improve soil management, the 16 Impact Accelerator businesses are driving innovations in clean energy, water, recycling, carbon removal, and energy efficiency. They span six time zones across the United States, and include family-owned small businesses, woman-owned enterprises, and public benefit corporations. Each share Apple’s commitment to serving communities disproportionately affected by climate change and other environmental challenges.

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the second generation ofAirPods Pro, the most advanced AirPods ever.With the power of the new H2 chip, AirPods Pro unlock breakthrough audio performance — including major upgrades to Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode — while also offering a unique way to experience Spatial Audio that’s even more immersive. Now, customers can enjoy Touch control for media playback and volume adjustments directly from the stem, along with longer battery life, a brand-new charging case, and an additional ear tip size for a better fit.
AirPods Pro (2nd generation) will be available to order online and in the Apple Store app starting Friday, September 9, with availability in stores beginning Friday, September 23.
“AirPods revolutionized the wireless headphone category with an innovative design and incredible sound quality. With the new AirPods Pro, Apple raises the bar once again,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “The new AirPods Pro deliver even better sound quality, a more immersive listening experience with Personalized Spatial Audio, and transformative audio features like Adaptive Transparency. With up to double the noise-cancelling power of their predecessor, the world’s bestselling wireless headphones just got even better.”
Breakthrough Audio
Built into a lightweight and compact body, the power of the new H2 chip provides an exceptional acoustic experience and cancels up to twice as much noise over the previous generation AirPods Pro. With a new low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier, AirPods Pro now offer richer bass and crystal-clear sound across a wider range of frequencies. Since the best audio experience isn’t complete without a great in-ear fit, a new extra small ear tip is included so even more people can experience the magic of AirPods Pro.
Transparency mode makes it possible for listeners to stay connected to and aware of the world around them. Now, Adaptive Transparency takes this customer-loved feature even further. The powerful H2 chip enables on-device processing, which reduces loud environmental noise — like a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, or even loud speakers at a concert — for more comfortable everyday listening.
Precise and Immersive Sound
With Personalized Spatial Audio, the AirPods listening experience is even more immersive. Users perceive sound individually, based on the size and shape of their head and ears. Using the TrueDepth camera on iPhone, users can create a personal profile for Spatial Audio that delivers a listening experience precisely tuned just for them. Users can enjoy Personalized Spatial Audio with music, movies, and TV shows — with dynamic head tracking — across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.1
Convenient Features
The magical experience users have come to love from the AirPods family gets even better with the next generation of AirPods Pro. Instant pairing to all Apple devices makes setup effortless, while the new dedicated AirPods section in iOS Settings lets users easily access and control their AirPods features.
Now, users can control media playback and turn up the volume without using another device. With Touch control on AirPods Pro, a light swipe up or down on the stem enables quick volume adjustments. Press the stem to change the music, answer phone calls, and more, or say “Hey Siri” to make requests hands-free. The improved, built-in skin-detect sensor more accurately turns on or off playback, and delivers better battery life.
Extended Battery Life
AirPods Pro offer 1.5 hours of additional listening time over the first generation, for a total of up to six hours with Active Noise Cancellation.2Using the case for four additional charges, users can enjoy up to 30 hours of total listening time with Active Noise Cancellation — a full six hours more than the previous generation.3
For more flexibility when traveling, customers can now charge AirPods Pro with an Apple Watch charger, in addition to a MagSafe charger, Qi-certified charging mat, or the Lightning cable.
All-New Charging Case
AirPods Pro come with a newly designed charging case that is sweat- and water-resistant,4and includes a lanyard loop5so it’s always within reach. With Precision Finding, users with a U1-enabled iPhone can locate their charging case with guided directions. The charging case also has a built-in speaker to deliver louder tones, so it’s even easier to locate.
Customers can now personalize the charging case with their individual Memoji, including custom-posed Memoji, Animoji, and a curated list of stickers. To begin engraving, create and upload a Memoji in the Apple Store app.
AirPods and the Environment
AirPods Pro are designed with numerous materials and features to minimize their impact on the environment, including the use of 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and — for the first time — 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. The case also uses 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board, and 100 percent recycled aluminum in the hinge. AirPods Pro are free of potentially harmful substances such as mercury, BFRs, PVC, and beryllium. Redesigned packaging eliminates the outer plastic wrap, and 90 percent or more of the packaging is made using fiber-based materials, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcediPhone 14 Proand iPhone 14 Pro Max, the most advanced Pro lineup ever, featuring the Dynamic Island — a new design that introduces an intuitive way to experience iPhone — and the Always-On display. Powered by A16 Bionic, the fastest chip ever in a smartphone, iPhone 14 Pro introduces a new class of pro camera system, with the first-ever 48MP Main camera on iPhone featuring a quad-pixel sensor, and Photonic Engine, an enhanced image pipeline that dramatically improves low-light photos. These groundbreaking advancements make iPhone even more indispensable for everyday tasks, creative projects, and now even emergency situations with features such as Emergency SOS via satellite and Crash Detection. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max will be available in four gorgeous new finishes: deep purple, silver, gold, and space black. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 9, with availability beginning Friday, September 16.
“Our customers count on their iPhone every day, and with iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max, we’re delivering more advancements than any other iPhone. iPhone 14 Pro introduces a camera system that empowers every user — from the casual user to the professional — to take their best photos and video, and innovative new technologies like the Always-On display and the Dynamic Island, which offers new interactions for notifications and activities,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Groundbreaking safety capabilities bring users even more security, offering help when they need it most. And with the incredibly powerful and efficient A16 Bionic chip and all-day battery life, this is the best iPhone yet.”
A Stunning Design and the Most Advanced Display on a Smartphone
iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max feature a beautiful surgical-grade stainless steel and textured matte glass design in four stunning colors. Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch sizes,1both models include a new Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion that features the Always-On display for the first time ever on iPhone, enabled by a new 1Hz refresh rate and multiple power-efficient technologies. This makes the new Lock Screen even more useful, keeping the time, widgets, and Live Activities available at a glance. The advanced display also brings the same peak HDR brightness level as Pro Display XDR, and the highest outdoor peak brightness in a smartphone: up to 2000 nits, which is twice as bright as iPhone 13 Pro.
iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max also continue to offer industry-leading durability features with the Ceramic Shield front cover — tougher than any smartphone glass — and are protected from common spills and accidents with water and dust resistance.2
Dynamic Island: An Interactive User Experience
The Dynamic Island enables new ways to interact with iPhone, featuring a design that blends the line between hardware and software, adapting in real time to show important alerts, notifications, and activities. With the introduction of the Dynamic Island, the TrueDepth camera has been redesigned to take up less of the display area. Without impeding content on the screen, the Dynamic Island maintains an active state to allow users easier access to controls with a simple tap-and-hold. Ongoing background activities like Maps, Music, or a timer remain visible and interactive, and third-party apps in iOS 16 that provide information like sports scores and ride-sharing with Live Activities can take advantage of the Dynamic Island.
A New Class of Pro Camera System
The pro camera system on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in a smartphone, empowering every user — casual or professional — to capture the best photos and video.
iPhone 14 Pro takes computational photography even further with Photonic Engine, offering a giant leap for mid- to low-light performance in photos across all cameras through a deep integration of hardware and software: up to 2x on the Main camera, up to 3x on the Ultra Wide camera, up to 2x on the Telephoto camera, and up to 2x on the TrueDepth camera. Photonic Engine enables this dramatic increase in quality by applying Deep Fusion earlier in the imaging process to deliver extraordinary detail, and preserve subtle textures, provide better color, and maintain more information in a photo.
For the first time ever, the Pro lineup features a new 48MP Main camera with a quad-pixel sensor that adapts to the photo being captured, and features second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization. For most photos, the quad-pixel sensor combines every four pixels into one large quad pixel equivalent to 2.44 µm, resulting in amazing low-light capture and keeping photo size at a practical 12MP. The quad-pixel sensor also enables a 2x Telephoto option that uses the middle 12 megapixels of the sensor for full-resolution photos and 4K videos with no digital zoom. This delivers optical quality at a familiar focal length, which is great for features like Portrait mode. The quad-pixel sensor also brings benefits to pro workflows, optimizing for detail in ProRAW. And with a new machine learning model designed specifically for the quad-pixel sensor, iPhone now shoots ProRAW at 48MP with an unprecedented level of detail, enabling new creative workflows for pro users.
Additional pro camera system upgrades and features include:
Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite
The entire iPhone 14 lineup introduces groundbreaking safety capabilities that can provide emergency assistance when it matters most. With a new dual-core accelerometer capable of detecting G-force measurements of up to 256Gs and a new high dynamic range gyroscope, Crash Detection on iPhone can now detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. These capabilities build on existing components, like the barometer, which can now detect cabin pressure changes, the GPS for additional input for speed changes, and the microphone,4which can recognize loud noises typified by severe car crashes. Advanced Apple-designed motion algorithms trained with over a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data provide even better accuracy. When combined with Apple Watch, Crash Detection seamlessly leverages the unique strength of both devices to get users help efficiently. When a severe crash is detected, the emergency services call interface will appear on Apple Watch, as it is most likely to be in closer proximity to the user, while the call is placed through iPhone if it is in range for the best possible connection.
The iPhone 14 lineup also introduces Emergency SOS via satellite, which combines custom components deeply integrated with software to allow antennas to connect directly to a satellite, enabling messaging with emergency services when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. Satellites are moving targets with low bandwidth, and it can take minutes for messages to get through. Since every second counts, with Emergency SOS via satellite, iPhone front-loads a few vital questions to assess the user’s situation and shows them where to point their phone to connect to a satellite. The initial questionnaire and follow-up messages are then relayed to centers staffed by Apple‑trained specialists who can call for help on the user’s behalf. This breakthrough technology also allows users to manually share their location over satellite with Find My when there is no cellular or Wi-Fi connection, providing a sense of security when hiking or camping off the grid. Emergency SOS via satellite will be available to users in the US and Canada in November, and the service will be free for two years.
A16 Bionic: The Fastest Chip in a Smartphone
The A16 Bionic chip in iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max is generations ahead of the competition, and unlocks unparalleled experiences like the Dynamic Island, powers all-day battery life,7and delivers impressive computational photography capabilities. With two high-performance cores and four high-efficiency cores, the new 6-core CPU is up to 40 percent faster than the competition and easily handles demanding workloads. A16 Bionic features an accelerated 5-core GPU with 50 percent more memory bandwidth — perfect for graphics-intensive games and apps — and a new 16-core Neural Engine capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second. Using Apple’s best-in-class fusion architecture to combine performance and energy savings, the chip delivers more performance with a fraction of the power compared to the competition.
Fundamental to the pro camera system, A16 Bionic powers incredible computational photography features. The CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and image signal processor seamlessly work together to support the new camera hardware and perform up to 4 trillion operations per photo.
Powerful Cellular Capabilities and 5G
iPhone offers users super-fast downloads and uploads, better streaming, and real-time connectivity with 5G to help them stay in touch, share, and enjoy content.8Support for 5G on iPhone now extends to over 250 carrier partners in over 70 markets around the world, with expanded support for standalone networks. eSIM allows users to easily connect or quickly transfer their existing plans digitally, is a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, and allows for multiple cellular plans on a single device. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max remove the SIM tray for US models, enabling users to more quickly and easily set up their device.
Apple Fitness+ for All iPhone Users
Later this fall, for the first time ever, Apple Fitness+ will be available for all iPhone users to subscribe to and enjoy in the 21 countries it is offered in, even if they don’t have an Apple Watch. iPhone users will have access to the entire service featuring over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations, all led by a diverse and inclusive team of trainers. Fitness+ users will see onscreen trainer guidance and interval timing, and estimated calories burned will be used to make progress on their Move ring. Fitness+ will be fully integrated with the Fitness app coming with iOS 16 and located in the middle tab, where users can stay motivated to close their Move ring through awards, activity sharing, and more. Users only need an iPhone to sign up, and can then experience Fitness+ on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.
Featuring iOS 16
Designed to take advantage of the new capabilities of iPhone 14 Pro, iOS 16 features a reimagined Lock Screen along with new communication, sharing, and intelligence features that together change the way users experience iPhone. The Lock Screen is more personal, beautiful, and helpful than ever with a multilayered effect that artfully sets subjects of photos in front of the time, and newly designed widgets that offer information at a glance. For Lock Screen inspiration, the wallpaper gallery offers a range of options, including Apple collections, a Weather wallpaper to see live weather conditions as they change throughout the day, an Astronomy wallpaper for views of the Earth, moon, and solar system, and many more. With Messages, users can now edit or recall recently sent messages, and mark conversations as unread to revisit them later.9iCloud Shared Photo Library makes it even easier to share a collection of photos with family.10Live Text gets more powerful with the ability to recognize text in video and quickly convert currency, translate text, and more, and Visual Look Up adds a new feature that allows users to tap and hold on the subject of an image to lift it from the background and place it in apps like Messages.11
iPhone and the Environment
iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are designed to minimize their impact on the environment, with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements used in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe, and 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. Both models also include 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and in the wire of all cameras. Fiber-based packaging does not use outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple reveals Apple Watch Series 8 and the new Apple Watch SE
Apple Watch Series 8 delivers best-in-class health features, including an innovative temperature sensor that enables advanced features for women’s health, and Crash Detection for severe car crashesThe redesigned Apple Watch SE delivers the core Apple Watch experience at a new starting price
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducedApple Watch Series 8and the newApple Watch SE, which bring groundbreaking technology and performance, and important safety innovations to the two best-selling smartwatches. Apple Watch Series 8 features the beloved design of Apple Watch, including a large, Always-On Retina display and a strong crack-resistant front crystal. With all-day 18-hour battery life, Apple Watch Series 8 builds on best-in-class health and safety features like the ECG app and fall detection by introducing temperature-sensing capabilities, retrospective ovulation estimates, Crash Detection, and international roaming. The new Apple Watch SE delivers the core Apple Watch experience, including Activity tracking, high and low heart rate notifications, and Emergency SOS, as well as the new Crash Detection feature and a completely redesigned back case that perfectly matches the three classic case finishes, all at a more affordable price of $249 (US). Both models are powered by watchOS 9, introducing new and more customizable watch faces like Lunar and Metropolitan, an enhanced Workout app, sleep stages, a first-of-its-kind AFib History feature, and an all-new Medications app.
Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE are available to order today, with availability beginning Friday, September 16.
“We hear from customers how Apple Watch helps them stay connected with loved ones, be more active, and live healthier lives,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Series 8 reinforces our commitment in these areas with the addition of pioneering technology, while Apple Watch SE brings advanced core features at a new starting price. Powered by watchOS 9, the best smartwatches deliver more capabilities than ever before.”
Wrist Temperature Sensing for Women’s Health
The menstrual cycle is an important marker of health, and many physicians consider it a vital sign. Apple Watch Series 8 features innovative new temperature-sensing capabilities that give women further insights into their health, designed with the same privacy protections as with all other health data.1
Apple Watch Series 8 takes a unique approach to temperature sensing with a two-sensor design — one sensor on the back of the watch, nearest the skin, and another just under the display — reducing bias from the outside environment.
Nighttime wrist temperature can be a good indicator of overall body temperature. The sensors in Apple Watch Series 8 sample the wrist temperature during sleep every five seconds and measure changes as small as 0.1° C. In the Health app, users can see nightly shifts in baseline temperature, which can be caused by exercise, jet lag, or even illness.2
Utilizing the new temperature-sensing capabilities in Apple Watch Series 8, users can receive retrospective ovulation estimates. Knowing when ovulation has occurred can be helpful for family planning, and Apple Watch Series 8 makes it easy and convenient by providing these estimates in the Health app. Temperature sensing also enables improved period predictions.
Additionally, with iOS 16 and watchOS 9, all Cycle Tracking users can now receive a notification if their logged cycle history shows a possible deviation, such as irregular, infrequent, or prolonged periods, and persistent spotting, which can be symptoms of underlying health conditions.
Crash Detection
To enable Crash Detection, Apple developed an advanced sensor-fusion algorithm that leverages a new, more powerful gyroscope and accelerometer on Apple Watch, which now has the highest dynamic range accelerometer in any smartwatch. To create the algorithm, data was collected from these new motion sensors at professional crash test labs with common passenger cars in simulated real-world accidents, including head-on, rear-end, side-impact, and rollovers. In addition to motion data, Crash Detection uses the barometer, GPS, and the microphone on iPhone as inputs to detect the unique patterns that can indicate whether a severe crash has taken place.
When Apple Watch detects a severe car crash, the device will check in with the user and dial emergency services if they are unresponsive after a 10-second countdown. Emergency responders will receive the user’s device location, which is also shared with the user’s emergency contacts. When combined, Crash Detection on Apple Watch and iPhone work seamlessly to get users help efficiently. When a severe car crash is detected, the emergency services call interface will appear on Apple Watch, as it is most likely to be in closer proximity to the user, while the call is placed through iPhone if it is in range for the best possible connection.
Low Power Mode
To keep users connected for even longer, a new Low Power Mode can extend battery life to reach up to 36 hours for Apple Watch Series 8 with iPhone present.3This new mode temporarily disables or limits select sensors and features, including the Always-On Retina display, workout autostart, heart health notifications, and more.
watchOS 9
The latest software brings new features and enhanced experiences to the world’s leading wearable operating system:
Apple Watch Series 8 Lineup
Apple Watch Series 8 will be available across a range of case finishes, colors, and band types to fit a variety of personal styles. Apple Watch Series 8 comes in aluminum and stainless steel cases in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm, and is compatible with all bands. Aluminum case colors for Apple Watch Series 8 include starlight, midnight, silver, and (PRODUCT)RED, while the stainless steel case offers silver, graphite, and gold. With Apple Watch Studio, Apple Watch Series 8 can be paired with any available band in the same collection.
Apple Watch Nike and Apple Watch Hermès also debut new bands and watch faces this fall. Nike has vibrant new Sport Band colors and a new Sport Loop with the “Just Do It” logo woven right into the band. Starting this fall, any Apple Watch user running watchOS 9 — even those without a Nike model — will be able to access all the Nike watch faces, including the fresh colors coming to the Bounce face.
Apple Watch Hermès introduces two new bands: H Diagonal, which creates a sporty pattern of the Hermès H with hundreds of microperforations, and Gourmette Metal, which features a polished stainless steel chain and noir leather wrapping twice around the wrist. A whimsical new Hermès watch face called Lucky Horse beautifully complements the new bands and celebrates the equestrian roots of the house with an animated horse that sleeps when the wrist is down and comes alive when it is raised.
Apple Watch SE
The new Apple Watch SE delivers advanced features at a new low price, and is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, use with Family Setup, or gift to their loved ones. Powerful upgrades include the S8 SiP advanced dual-core processor, the same processor that is in Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, making it 20 percent faster than the previous generation, along with Crash Detection and international roaming.
Apple Watch SE maintains the same case design, but features a redesigned matching back case made of a nylon composite material, making it lighter than ever. With watchOS 9, Apple Watch SE users can enjoy the benefits of the new Compass app in addition to the enhanced fitness and wellness features. Apple Watch SE is available in 40mm and 44mm aluminum cases, in midnight, starlight, and silver finishes, and is compatible with all bands.
Apple Watch and the Environment
Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch SE are designed to minimize their impact on the environment. Both models are made with 100 percent recycled aluminum in the case, 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. In a first for Apple Watch, both models feature 100 percent recycled gold — in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards on Apple Watch Series 8, and in the plating of the SiP on the new Apple Watch SE. Both models are free of mercury, BFRs, PVC, and beryllium. No Apple Watch packaging uses outer plastic wrap, and 94 percent or more of the packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s iPhone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus
A new, larger 6.7-inch size joins the popular 6.1-inch design, featuring a new dual-camera system, Crash Detection, a smartphone industry-first safety service with Emergency SOS via satellite, and the best battery life on iPhone
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducediPhone 14and iPhone 14 Plus, featuring two sizes — 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches — in a sophisticated design with impressive camera upgrades and groundbreaking new safety capabilities. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus take stunning photos and video with a powerful camera system featuring new Main and front TrueDepth cameras, the Ultra Wide camera for unique perspectives, and Photonic Engine — an enhanced image pipeline. Both models include the A15 Bionic chip with a 5-core GPU, which offers incredible performance and efficiency for demanding workloads, and is designed with privacy and security built in. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus introduce critical safety capabilities such as Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite, a first in the industry. And with amazing battery life, industry-leading durability features, and super-fast 5G, this iPhone lineup is more advanced than ever before. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus will be available in midnight, blue, starlight, purple, and (PRODUCT)RED1finishes. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 9, with availability for iPhone 14 beginning Friday, September 16, and availability for iPhone 14 Plus beginning Friday, October 7.
“Our customers rely on their iPhone every day, and iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus introduce groundbreaking new technologies and important safety capabilities. With the new, larger 6.7-inch display on iPhone 14 Plus, users can enjoy more content onscreen when browsing the web and even more text,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Both phones have a powerful new Main camera with a huge leap in low-light performance, advanced connectivity capabilities with 5G and eSIM, and the incredible performance of A15 Bionic, which helps enable even better battery life. All of this, tightly integrated with iOS 16, makes iPhone more essential than ever.”
A Beautiful and Durable Design with Amazing Battery Life
Available in the popular 6.1-inch size and a stunning new 6.7-inch size,2iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature a durable and sleek aerospace-grade aluminum design in five beautiful finishes. The larger display of iPhone 14 Plus is great for streaming movies and playing games, and iPhone 14 Plus boasts the best battery life ever in an iPhone.3Both models have an updated internal design for better thermal performance, gorgeous Super Retina XDR displays with OLED technology that supports 1200 nits of peak HDR brightness, a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and Dolby Vision.
iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus also feature the durable Ceramic Shield front cover — exclusive to iPhone and tougher than any other smartphone glass — and are protected from common spills and accidents with water and dust resistance.4
Powerful Camera Upgrades Enabled by Photonic Engine
iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus introduce a new standard for photo and video capture with a new 12MP Main camera featuring a larger sensor and larger pixels, a new front TrueDepth camera, the Ultra Wide camera to capture more of a scene, and Photonic Engine for a giant leap in low-light performance.
Through a deep integration of hardware and software, Photonic Engine improves mid- to low-light performance for photos across all cameras: up to 2x on the Ultra Wide camera, 2x on the TrueDepth camera, and an impressive 2.5x on the new Main camera. Photonic Engine enables this dramatic increase in quality by applying the computational benefits of Deep Fusion earlier in the imaging process to deliver extraordinary detail, and preserve subtle textures, provide better color, and maintain more information in a photo.
Dual-camera system upgrades and features include:
Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite
The entire iPhone 14 lineup introduces groundbreaking safety capabilities that can provide emergency assistance when it matters most. With a new dual-core accelerometer capable of detecting G-force measurements of up to 256Gs and a new high dynamic range gyroscope, Crash Detection on iPhone can now detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. These capabilities build on existing components, like the barometer, which can now detect cabin pressure changes, the GPS for additional input for speed changes, and the microphone,5which can recognize loud noises typified by severe car crashes. Advanced Apple-designed motion algorithms trained with over a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data provide even better accuracy. When combined with Apple Watch, Crash Detection seamlessly leverages the unique strength of both devices to get users help efficiently. When a severe crash is detected, the emergency services call interface will appear on Apple Watch, as it is most likely to be in closer proximity to the user, while the call is placed through iPhone if it is in range for the best possible connection.6
The iPhone 14 lineup also introduces Emergency SOS via satellite, which combines custom components deeply integrated with software to allow antennas to connect directly to a satellite, enabling messaging with emergency services when outside of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage. Satellites are moving targets with low bandwidth, and it can take minutes for messages to get through. Since every second counts, with Emergency SOS via satellite, iPhone front-loads a few vital questions to assess the user’s situation, and shows them where to point their phone to connect to a satellite. The initial questionnaire and follow-up messages are then relayed to centers staffed by Apple‑trained specialists who can call for help on the user’s behalf. This breakthrough technology also allows users to manually share their location over satellite with Find My when there is no cellular or Wi-Fi connection, providing a sense of security when hiking or camping off the grid. Emergency SOS via satellite will be available to users in the US and Canada in November, and the service will be free for two years.7
A15 Bionic: A Powerhouse with a 5-Core GPU
A15 Bionic brings incredible performance to iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. Still faster than all the competition at any price, the 5-core GPU enables even smoother graphics for video apps and high-performance gaming, and powers incredible camera features like Photonic Engine and Cinematic mode, all while delivering impressive battery life, and protecting privacy and security with the Secure Enclave. The 6-core CPU handles demanding tasks smoothly and efficiently, and the 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features in iOS 16 and third-party app experiences.
Powerful Connection Capabilities
iPhone offers users super-fast downloads and uploads, better streaming, and real-time connectivity with 5G to help them stay in touch, share, and enjoy content.8Support for 5G on iPhone now extends to over 250 carrier partners in over 70 markets around the world, with expanded support for standalone networks. eSIM allows users to easily connect or quickly transfer their existing plans digitally, is a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, and allows for multiple cellular plans on a single device. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus remove the SIM tray for US models, enabling users to more quickly and easily set up their devices.
Apple Fitness+ for All iPhone Users
Later this fall, for the first time ever, Apple Fitness+ will be available for all iPhone users to subscribe to and enjoy in the 21 countries it is offered in, even if they don’t have an Apple Watch. iPhone users will have access to the entire service featuring over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations, all led by a diverse and inclusive team of trainers. Fitness+ users will see onscreen trainer guidance and interval timing, and estimated calories burned will be used to make progress on their Move ring. Fitness+ will be fully integrated with the Fitness app coming with iOS 16 and located in the middle tab, where users can stay motivated to close their Move ring through awards, activity sharing, and more. Usersonly need an iPhone to sign up, and can then experience Fitness+ on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.
Featuring iOS 16
iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus feature iOS 16, offering a reimagined Lock Screen along with new communication, sharing, and intelligence features that together change the way users experience iPhone. The Lock Screen is more personal, beautiful, and helpful than ever with a multilayered effect that artfully sets subjects of photos in front of the time, and newly designed widgets that offer information at a glance. For Lock Screen inspiration, the wallpaper gallery offers a range of options, including Apple collections, a Weather wallpaper to see live weather conditions as they change throughout the day, an Astronomy wallpaper for views of the Earth, moon, and solar system, and many more. With Messages, users can now edit or recall recently sent messages, and mark conversations as unread to revisit them later.9iCloud Shared Photo Library makes it even easier to share a collection of photos with family.10Live Text gets more powerful with the ability to recognize text in video and quickly convert currency, translate text, and more, and Visual Look Up adds a new feature that allows users to tap and hold on the subject of an image to lift it from the background and place it in apps like Messages.11
iPhone and the Environment
iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are designed to minimize their impact on the environment, including antenna lines that use upcycled plastic water bottles that have been chemically transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material. iPhone 14 models also use 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe, and 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. Both models also include 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and in the wire of all cameras. Fiber-based packaging does not use outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.

2022-09-07,Increase,Introducing Apple Watch Ultra,"Text of this article
September 7, 2022
PRESS RELEASE
Introducing Apple Watch Ultra
Inspired by the most extreme activities, Apple unveils a revolutionary new design with breakthrough capabilities
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcedApple Watch Ultra, which brings a new bold design and a wide range of features built for endurance, exploration, and adventure. Apple Watch Ultra introduces a 49mm titanium case and flat sapphire front crystal that reveals the biggest and brightest Apple Watch display yet. A customizable Action button offers instant access to a wide range of useful features. Apple Watch Ultra has the best battery life of any Apple Watch, reaching up to 36 hours during normal use.1Additionally, a new low-power setting, ideal for multi-day experiences, can extend battery life to reach up to 60 hours.2The Wayfinder watch face is designed specifically for the larger Apple Watch Ultra display and includes a compass built into the dial, with space for up to eight complications. Apple Watch Ultra also brings three new bands — Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band — offering unique design features that provide a secure and comfortable fit for every adventure.
Apple Watch Ultra is available to order today, with availability beginning Friday, September 23.
“Inspired by explorers and athletes from around the world, we created an entirely new category of Apple Watch designed for new and extreme environments — it’s the most rugged and capable Apple Watch yet,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Ultra is a versatile tool that empowers users to push their boundaries with adventure, endurance, and exploration.”
Bigger, Brighter, and Stronger
Made from aerospace-grade titanium, Apple Watch Ultra provides the perfect balance of weight, durability, and corrosion resistance. The case rises up to surround all edges of the flat sapphire front crystal, protecting the Retina display, which is up to 2000 nits — 2x brighter than any Apple Watch display yet. The new Action button in high-contrast international orange is easily customized for instant access to a variety of features, including Workouts, Compass Waypoints, Backtrack, and more.
Apple Watch Ultra has three built-in microphones to significantly improve sound quality in voice calls during any conditions. An adaptive beamforming algorithm uses the microphones to capture voice while reducing ambient background sounds, resulting in remarkable clarity. In challenging windy environments, Apple Watch Ultra uses advanced wind noise-reduction algorithms, including machine learning, to deliver clear and intelligible audio for calls.
New Bands Designed for the Great Outdoors
Designed specifically for endurance athletes and runners, the Trail Loopband is the thinnest Apple Watch band to date. The lightweight woven textile is both soft and flexible, allowing it to cinch to the optimal fit, and the convenient tab is designed for quick and easy adjustment.
With explorers in mind, the Alpine Loop band features two integrated layers made from one continuous weaving process that eliminates the need for stitching. The top loops, interspersed with high-strength yarn, provide adjustability and a secure attachment for the titanium G-hook fastener.
The Ocean Bandis designed specifically for extreme water sports and recreational diving with a titanium buckle and corresponding spring-loaded loop. Molded from a flexible fluoroelastomer, it stretches and utilizes the tubular geometry for a secure fit. The Ocean Band also has an optional extra-long tail that allows users to comfortably wear over a wetsuit.
Endurance Sports and Elite Athletes
Apple Watch Ultra is an incredible tool for endurance athletes or those who aspire to push beyond their limits. For the first time ever in an Apple Watch, the precision dual-frequency GPS integrates both L1 and the latest frequency, L5, plus new positioning algorithms. Apple Watch Ultra delivers the most accurate GPS of any Apple Watch to date, providing users the most precise distance, pace, and route data for training and competing.
Apple Watch Ultra is powered by watchOS 9, which includes new advanced running metrics to measure performance, like Stride Length, Ground Contact Time, Vertical Oscillation, and Running Power. New Workout Views, such as Segments, Splits, and Elevation, provide important metrics at just a glance, and thanks to the larger display, Apple Watch Ultra is the only Apple Watch that can show six metrics at once. Users can take their training to the next level with features such as Heart Rate Zones, Custom Workouts, Pacer, and, coming later this year, Race Route. For triathlons, duathlons, or activities with any sequence of swimming, biking, or running, the new Multisport workout includes autodetection to easily switch between workouts. Apple Watch Ultra has enough battery life for most users to complete a long-course triathlon, consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and full marathon at 26.2 miles.
The Action button can instantly begin workouts and move users to the next interval of a Custom Workout or the next leg of a Multisport workout. It can also be used to mark segments, complementing the new Track running experience, which automatically provides the ultimate pacing and distance estimates for runners at a track.3
Explorers
With the bigger, brighter display and rugged design, Apple Watch Ultra is the perfect technical tool for adventurers and explorers in a range of environments, from the every day to the extreme. The completely redesigned Compass app in watchOS 9 surfaces more in-depth information and three distinct views. The app displays a new hybrid view that simultaneously shows both an analog compass dial and a digital view. Turning the Digital Crown reveals an additional view that includes latitude, longitude, elevation, and incline, as well as an orienteering view showing Compass Waypoints and Backtrack.
Compass Waypoints are a quick and convenient way to mark a location or point of interest directly in the app. Pressing the Action button or tapping the Compass Waypoint icon drops a waypoint that can be edited by tapping the icon that appears. The Compass Waypoint complication updates dynamically in real time with both the direction of the waypoint as well as the approximate distance.
Backtrack uses GPS data to create a path showing where the user has been, which is useful if they get lost or disoriented and need help retracing their steps. It can also turn on automatically in the background when off the grid. With a single press of the Action button, users can quickly drop a Compass Waypoint or start or view a Backtrack. An 86-decibel siren is designed for emergencies, should users become lost or injured, and can help draw attention to a location. The unique sound signature incorporates two distinct alternating patterns, which can repeat for up to several hours. The first pattern suggests distress, while the second mimics the universally recognized SOS pattern. For multi-day backpacking trips, battery life can be extended to reach up to 60 hours using Low Power Mode plus an additional low-power setting that reduces frequency of GPS and heart rate readings.
The on-wrist operating temperature was designed to help explore the most extreme and remote locations, from freezing cold mountains at -4° F (-20° C) to the blazing desert heat at 131° F (55° C).4Apple Watch Ultra is certified to the relevant aspects of MIL-STD-810H, used for military equipment and popular among rugged equipment manufacturers. Testing includes Low Pressure (Altitude), High Temperature, Low Temperature, Temperature Shock, Contamination by Fluids, Rain, Humidity, Immersion, Sand and Dust, Freeze/Thaw, Ice/Freezing Rain, Shock, Vibration, and more.To optimize for evening conditions, turning the Digital Crown makes the interface red for better visibility in the dark when using the Wayfinder face.
Ocean and Water Sports Enthusiasts
Apple Watch Ultra is designed for water sports, including extreme activities like kitesurfing and wakeboarding, along with recreational scuba diving to 40 meters with the new Oceanic+ app. To support these underwater adventures, Apple Watch Ultra is certified to WR100. Apple Watch Ultra is also certified to EN 13319, which is an internationally recognized standard for dive accessories, including depth gauges that are relied upon by recreational divers around the world.5
Utilizing a new depth gauge, Apple Watch Ultra features a Depth app designed with an intuitive user interface. With just a glance, the Depth app displays time, current depth, water temperature, duration under water, and max depth reached. Users can program the Action button to instantly launch the Depth app.
In partnership with Huish Outdoors, known for delivering innovative and reliable equipment for recreational diving, the new Oceanic+ app turns Apple Watch Ultra into a capable dive computer. Available from the App Store later this fall, the app runs the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, and includes dive planning, easy-to-read dive metrics, visual and haptic alerts, no-decompression limit, ascent rate, and safety stop guidance. Oceanic+ also offers a personalized user profile, reports on current and local dive conditions, and a dive logbook that can be shared with family and friends and automatically syncs to iPhone.
“We’re thrilled to partner with Apple to combine our world-renowned expertise in scuba with the unique capability of Apple Watch Ultra to turn the same everyday watch into an innovative dive computer,” said Mike Huish, CEO of Huish Outdoors. “With Oceanic+, Apple Watch Ultra users can enjoy a new and enriched experience during scuba activities.”
Additional Features
Apple Watch Ultra includes all of the connectivity, activity, and health features that have made Apple Watch the best-selling smartwatch in the world — from heart rate monitoring and the ECG and Blood Oxygen apps, to Activity rings and Mindfulness, along with additional health, safety, and navigation features.
Apple Watch Ultra features innovative new temperature-sensing capabilities that enable further insights into women’s health. The unique two-sensor design reduces bias from the outside environment and the body itself. Utilizing the new capabilities, users can receive retrospective ovulation estimates, which can be helpful for family planning.6Temperature sensing also enables improved period predictions for users who menstruate.7With iOS 16 and watchOS 9, Cycle Tracking users can now receive a notification if their logged cycle history shows a possible deviation, which can be a symptom of underlying health conditions.
Apple Watch Ultra and the Environment
Apple Watch Ultra is designed to minimize its impact on the environment. It features recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards — a first for Apple Watch — as well as 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. Display glass is arsenic-free, and Apple Watch Ultra is mercury-, BFR-, PVC-, and beryllium-free. No Apple Watch packaging uses outer plastic wrap, and 98 percent or more of the packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s iPhone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.

September 12, 2022
UPDATE
iOS 16 is available today
iOS 16 brings the biggest update ever to the Lock Screen, the ability to edit and collaborate in Messages, new tools in Mail, and more ways to interact with photos and video with Live Text and Visual Look Up.iOS 16is available today as a free software update.
A More Personal, Beautiful, and Helpful Lock Screen
The Lock Screen gets reimagined, offering deeper personalization. Now users can add a depth effect to their Lock Screen photo, artfully displaying the photo subject in front of the time, and they can even customize the font and type style. New widgets on the Lock Screen make it easy to get helpful information at a glance like upcoming calendar events, battery levels, alarms, time zones, Activity ring progress, and more.
The new Lock Screen gallery features a range of options. Users can choose an intelligently suggested photo from their personal library that will look great on the Lock Screen, or a dynamic set of photos that shuffle throughout the day. Apple collections include iconic imagery from Apple; Pride and Unity wallpapers; a Weather wallpaper to see live weather conditions as they change throughout the day; and an Astronomy wallpaper for views of the Earth, moon, and solar system. Users can also create unique designs with their favorite emoji and color combinations, and with multiple Lock Screens, users can switch between their favorites with just a swipe.
Redesigned notifications now roll in from the bottom to offer a clear view of the Lock Screen, and users can choose to view notifications in an expanded list, stacked, or as a count view.
Stay in the Moment With Focus
With iOS 16, Focus is easier to set up and gets even more powerful by connecting to the Lock Screen, giving users a way to simply swipe to a designated Lock Screen to activate the corresponding Focus. With Focus filters, apps like Calendar, Mail, Messages, and Safari can display only the content that is relevant to a user’s Focus, helping them to find better balance.
New Ways to Interact in Messages
Updates to Messages make it possible to edit, undo send, and mark conversations as unread, making it even easier to stay connected.1With iOS 16, users can now invite friends and family to SharePlay via Messages, offering another way to enjoy synced content like movies or songs and shared playback controls. In addition, new collaboration features in Messages make working with others quick and seamless. When users choose to share files for collaboration through Messages, everyone in a thread will be automatically added, and when someone makes an edit to the shared document, activity updates appear at the top of the thread.
Increase Productivity With New Tools in Mail
Now users can schedule delivery of an email ahead of time or cancel delivery of a message before it reaches a recipient’s inbox.2Users can also set reminders to come back to a message at a later date with Remind me, receive automatic suggestions to follow up on an email if they haven’t received a response, and get automatic alerts when they’ve forgotten to include a recipient or attachment in an email. With the biggest update to search in years, Mail features state-of-the-art techniques to deliver more relevant, accurate, and complete search results.
Visual Look Up and Live Text Enhancements
Users can now tap and hold on the subject of an image to lift it from the background and place it in apps like Messages. Visual Look Up also expands to recognize birds, insects, spiders, and statues, helping users quickly get information about objects and scenes in photos.
Using on-device intelligence, Live Text can now recognize text in videos across the system. Users can pause a video on any frame to interact with text and take quick action, such as copy and paste, translate, convert currency, and more.
More Secure Browsing in Safari With Passkeys
Browsing in Safari is even safer with passkeys, a next-generation credential that can’t be phished or leaked, making it more secure and easy to use. Designed to replace passwords, passkeys use Touch ID or Face ID for biometric verification, and iCloud Keychain to sync across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV with end-to-end encryption. Created as a joint effort in collaboration with the FIDO Alliance, Google, and Microsoft, passkeys will work across apps and the web, and users can sign in to websites or an app on non-Apple devices using just their iPhone.
Safari also adds shared Tab Groups to share a collection of websites with friends and family, making it seamless to add tabs and see what others are viewing.
New Accessibility Features to Navigate, Stay Connected, and More
Accessibility updates include Door Detection, which helps users who are blind or low vision use their iPhone to navigate the last few feet to their destination; and Apple Watch Mirroring for users with physical and motor disabilities to mirror their Apple Watch display to iPhone, and control Apple Watch with Voice Control and Switch Control.3Additionally, Live Captions make it easier for Deaf and hard of hearing users to follow along with any audio content — whether they are on a phone or FaceTime call, using a videoconference or social media app, streaming media content, or having a conversation with someone next to them.4

2022-09-12,Increase,watchOS 9 is available today,"Text of this article
September 12, 2022
UPDATE
watchOS 9 is available today
New watch faces, an enhanced Workout app, sleep stages, a first-of-its-kind AFib History feature, a redesigned Compass app, and an all-new Medications app are here
Apple today launchedwatchOS 9, which brings new features and enhanced experiences to the world’s leading wearable operating system. Apple Watch users now have more watch faces to choose from, with richer complications that provide more information and opportunity for personalization. In the updated Workout app, advanced metrics, views, and training experiences inspired by high-performing athletes help users take their workouts to the next level. The Sleep app includes sleep stages, and for users diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib), the new FDA-cleared AFib History feature provides deeper insights into a user’s condition. The new Medications app makes it easy for users to conveniently and discreetly manage, understand, and track medications.
New and Expanded Watch Faces
watchOS 9 introduces four new faces: Lunar, which depicts the relationship between the Gregorian calendar and lunar calendar, used in many cultures such as Chinese, Hebrew, and Islamic; Playtime, a dynamic piece of art that’s unique to Apple Watch and created in collaboration with artist Joi Fulton; Metropolitan, a classic, type-driven watch face where the style changes as the Digital Crown is turned; and Astronomy, an original face that has been completely remastered and features a new star map and current cloud data.
The update brings enhanced and modernized complications to some of the most classic watch faces, such as Utility, Simple, and Activity Analog, along with background color editing for Modular, Modular Compact, and X-Large for additional personalization. The Portraits face showcases the depth effect on more photos, including cats, dogs, and landscapes, while Chinese scripts have been added as options for California and Typograph watch faces. For the first time, any Apple Watch user running watchOS 9 — even those without a Nike model — will be able to access all the Nike watch faces, including the fresh colors coming to the Bounce face.
Focus now allows users to select an Apple Watch face to automatically appear when they start a specific Focus on iPhone, such as the Photos face during a Personal Focus, helping users stay in the moment.
Workout App Updates
The Workout app, one of the most popular apps on Apple Watch, has been updated to provide richer metrics for measuring performance, as well as new training experiences to help users reach their fitness goals. The familiar in-session display now uses the Digital Crown to rotate between easy-to-read Workout Views, so users can see important metrics for different training styles. Heart Rate Zones, utilizing personalized Health data, can be used to monitor the intensity of a workout. For interval training, the Workout app introduces Custom Workouts, which can be used to create a structured workout that includes work and recovery intervals. New alerts, including pace, power, heart rate, and cadence, can be added to guide users throughout their workout.
For triathletes and duathletes, the Workout app now supports a new Multisport workout type that automatically switches between any sequence of swimming, biking, and running workouts, using motion sensors to recognize movement patterns. There is also a redesigned summary page in the Fitness app on iPhone that offers additional details with interactive charts for more precise analysis of all workouts.
Updates for Runners
Apple Watch is already a powerful tool for runners, and watchOS 9 brings more data and features to help track how efficiently users run. New running form metrics, including Stride Length, Ground Contact Time, and Vertical Oscillation, can all be added as metrics on Workout Views. These metrics appear in the Fitness app summary and in the Health app, where users can see trends over time and learn from patterns.
A new Pacer experience lets users choose a distance and goal for the time in which they want to complete a run, and calculates the pace required to achieve the goal. During the workout, they can follow the pace alerts and metrics provided. Coming later this year, Race Route enables users to race against their best or last result on frequently completed routes, and receive in-session pacing guidance. A new Track running experience, coming later this year to the US, automatically detects that users are at a running track, and uses Apple Maps data along with GPS to provide the ultimate pace and distance metrics for runners.
Swimming Enhancements
Kickboard has been added as a new stroke type for Pool Swim workouts, using sensor fusion on Apple Watch to automatically detect when users are swimming with a kickboard and classify the stroke type in the workout summary along with distance swam. Swimmers can now track their efficiency with a SWOLF score — a stroke count combined with the time, in seconds, it takes to swim one length of the pool. Users can view their SWOLF average for each set in the workout summary.
Redesigned Compass App
A completely redesignedCompass app provides more in-depth information and new zoomable views, including a hybrid view that simultaneously shows both an analog compass dial and a digital view. Turning the Digital Crown reveals an additional view that includes latitude, longitude, elevation, and incline, as well as an orienteering view showing Compass Waypoints and Backtrack.
Backtrack uses GPS data to create a path showing where the user has been, which is useful if they get lost or disoriented and need help retracing their steps. It can also turn on automatically in the background when off the grid. Compass Waypoints are a quick and convenient way to mark a location or point of interest directly in the app. Tapping the Compass Waypoint icon drops a waypoint. Selecting one provides a targeted view of the direction of the waypoint and an approximation of how far away it is.
Sleep Insights
The Sleep experience on Apple Watch already empowers users to create Wind Down and Bedtime schedules, as well as track their sleep to help them meet their goals. Sleep tracking in watchOS 9 provides even more insights with the introduction of sleep stages. Using signals from the accelerometer, Apple Watch can estimate when users are in REM, Core, or Deep sleep, and when they are awake. Users will see sleep stage data on Apple Watch in the Sleep app and can view more detailed information, like time asleep, alongside additional metrics, like heart rate and respiratory rate, in sleep comparison charts in the Health app on iPhone.
The machine learning models were trained and validated against the clinical gold standard, polysomnography, with one of the largest and most diverse populations ever studied for a wearable. As the science of sleep is still being explored, users in the US will be able to aid in potential discoveries by contributing their sleep stage data in the Apple Heart and Movement Study through the Research app.
First-of-Its-Kind AFib History
Research suggests that the amount of time spent in AFib may impact a person’s symptoms, overall quality of life, and risk of complications.1Previously, there has not been an easy way to track the frequency of AFib over an extended period of time, or to manage lifestyle factors that may influence one’s condition.
With watchOS 9, users who are diagnosed with AFib can turn on the FDA-cleared AFib History feature2and access important information, including an estimate of how frequently a user’s heart rhythm shows signs of AFib, providing deeper insights into their condition.3Users will also receive weekly notifications to understand frequency and view a detailed history in the Health app, including lifestyle factors that may influence AFib, like sleep, alcohol consumption, and exercise.
Users can download a PDF with a detailed history of their AFib and lifestyle factors, which can easily be shared with doctors and care providers for more informed conversations.
Medications
The new Medications experience on Apple Watch and iPhone helps users manage and track their medications, vitamins, and supplements, allowing them to create a medications list, set up schedules and reminders, and view information on their medications in the Health app. The Medications app on Apple Watch makes it easy for users to conveniently and discreetly track medications anytime, anywhere.
Custom schedules can be created for each medication, whether it needs to be taken multiple times a day, once a week, or as needed, and users can set up reminders to help keep them on track. In the US, users can quickly add medications using their iPhone camera, and receive an alert if there are potential critical interactions with medications they have added to the Health app.4
Updates to Cycle Tracking
With iOS 16 and watchOS 9, Cycle Tracking users can now receive a notification if their logged cycle history shows a possible deviation, such as irregular, infrequent, or prolonged periods, and persistent spotting, which can be symptoms of underlying health conditions.
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s iPhone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any health data synced to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.

Chu, the series follows a young girl named Hilde (played by Brooklynn Prince) who moves from the city of Brooklyn to the small lakeside town her father left behind.

They then discover that they can’t leave until they find “true love.”

Ben Stiller, Nicky Weinstock, and Jackie Cohn executive produce through Red Hour Productions, and both Patricia Arquette and Adam Scott serve as producers. Endeavor Content serves as the studio.

But what he lacks in knowledge, he makes up for with optimism, underdog determination — and biscuits. The widely acclaimed series also stars Hannah Waddingham, Brendan Hunt, Jeremy Swift, Juno Temple, Brett Goldstein, Phil Dunster, and Nick Mohammed.
In addition to starring, Sudeikis serves as executive producer, alongside Bill Lawrence via his Doozer Productions, in association with Warner Bros. and Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.

2022-09-27,Decrease,iPad Pro is revolutionizing how archaeologists preserve the ancient history of Pompeii,"This is the cleanest and clearest archaeology I have ever done, and iPad Pro is such a huge part of that.
Dr. Allison Emmerson, Tulane University
Text of this article

FEATURE
iPad Pro is revolutionizing how archaeologists preserve the ancient history of Pompeii
It’s Tuesday morning of the final week of the archaeology team’s excavation at Pompeii, and everyone is buzzing.
The day before, a trove of artifacts was discovered inside a pit in an ancient Roman kitchen, and Tulane University professor Dr. Allison Emmerson, who is leading the dig, believes the team has not yet reached the bottom and all of its contents. Each new discovery provides a clue to unlocking the story behind the site and the people who used it.
Amid the tools used by archaeologists for centuries — trowels, buckets, brushes, and pickaxes — there’s a new piece of equipment: iPad Pro.
“iPad is the perfect archaeology machine,” says Dr.  Emmerson, who was part of the team that pioneered its use to record data on archaeological digs in 2010. She credits iPad with revolutionizing the field.
This summer, Dr. Emmerson — whose work focuses on ancient Roman communities that have largely been excluded from study, such as women, the poor, and the enslaved — has made iPad Pro the center of her team’s workflow. She believes it will once again reshape the field, thanks to capabilities like enhanced processing speed and battery life, the LiDAR Scanner, and the versatility of Apple Pencil.
“Archaeological excavation is a destructive process — once a location has been dug, that work can never be repeated — so our most essential concern is thorough recording of all relevant data so that future researchers can ‘reconstruct the site,’” says Emmerson. “iPad Pro allows us to collect data faster, more accurately, and more securely than any other tool, and has the processing power we need to aggregate that information and present it in a way no one has before.”
Mount Vesuvius erupted in the fall of 79 C.E. (Common Era, also known as A.D.), burying the city of Pompeii in volcanic material. Seventeen years earlier, a major earthquake severely damaged the city, and some archaeologists believe that in between those two events, Pompeii was a city in decline.
For this year’s five-week dig, called the Tulane University Pompeii I.14 Project after the building’s location on the city grid, Dr. Emmerson brought together archaeologists and students from schools on both sides of the Atlantic to excavate a commercial building believed to be a restaurant dating to the second or third century B.C.E. (before the Common Era, also known as B.C.).
The group also includes a tech team co-led by Dr. Alex Elvis Badillo, a digital archaeologist Dr. Emmerson has been working with for the last year to pioneer new techniques for recording and publishing archaeological findings.
This summer, Dr. Badillo and Dr. Emmerson had two technology goals: to implement a completely paperless workflow using a single device, and to create an online database that would allow others to virtually “re-excavate” the site. Dr. Badillo knew that iPad Pro with Apple Pencil would serve as the foundation for their work, and selectedEsri’s suite of tools, as well asConceptsby TopHatch, as additional apps.
This transformed the dig, especially for the team’s two excavation supervisors, Dr. Jordan Rogers, who teaches at Carleton College, and Mary-Evelyn Farrior, who is currently completing her PhD at Columbia University. They each oversaw a separate area of the site, called a trench, and were responsible for directing the undergraduate excavators and recording the majority of data collected.
“The way I have always recorded on past digs was on paper with pencils or pens,” says Rogers. “And when you drew something, you did it on graph paper, and used string and levels to measure where things were located. Photos were taken on separate cameras that you had to upload manually once you got back home. Everything was in a different place, and every night involved many hours transferring your day’s notes onto your computer.”
Now, as Dr. Rogers and his trench team dig further down into the kitchen pit that yielded so many surprises the day before, the only recording tool he holds is iPad Pro with Apple Pencil.
“Initially, I was a little apprehensive because I’d never used iPad before,” says Rogers. “But the learning curve was so quick, and it’s really incredible how much more effective and efficient it’s made the process of data capture, especially with Apple Pencil. I also feel a lot better not having to worry I’m going to lose a sheet of paper — and there used to be so many sheets of paper.”
Dr. Badillo customized Esri’s ArcGIS Survey123 app so that the archaeologists could input more than 50 fields of distinct information on their iPad Pro, including attachments like photos and sketches.
“I’ve used iPad in the field twice before this dig,” says Farrior. “But this is the first time I used iPad Pro and have been able to collect all types of information in one place. I’m sketching trench plans in Concepts with Apple Pencil, I’m taking photos with the camera, I’m typing in my observations on the Magic Keyboard. I’m able to bring all of these things together at incredible speed — and the battery has lasted all day in extreme temperatures and the dusty environment of the excavation.”
Dr. Rogers also used the LiDAR Scanner on iPad Pro in combination with3d Scanner Appby Laan Labs to create three-dimensional maps of his trenches.
“It’s really fast — it only takes about 10 to 15 seconds to scan, and it was so easy,” says Rogers. “It’s done a really good job of capturing all the detail and stitching it together, which is going to be so helpful for me to refer back to when we’re analyzing the data at the end of the dig.”
As Rogers and his team dig further down into the kitchen pit, they find more artifacts, including pieces of a decorative mask, parts of cooking vessels, animal bones, and a tiny lamp — each of which is helping the archaeologists understand how and when this restaurant was used. Those clues are starting to point to a different time period than the team previously thought — and an environment that suggests a city on the rise, not one that was crumbling.
One of the dig’s most revealing clues was unearthed a few weeks before in Farrior’s trench. An undergraduate student was sifting through a bucket of dirt and discovered a coin. In fact, it was an incredibly rare aureus, a gold coin commissioned by the Emperor Augustus in the final year of his life, which dates it to the year 13 or the first part of 14 C.E.
“It was found under a pavement in a room, so it seems to be a deliberate placement — probably as an offering to a god as they were constructing or reconstructing the space,” says Dr. Emmerson. “So we get a really clear vision that this floor was put in place at a certain moment in time.”
The coin and all notable artifacts found were collected by the digital team for 3D scans. Those scans, along with the rest of the information gathered on the dig, were then aggregated to create an interactive database of the site that anyone will eventually be able to access online so that they can essentially re-excavate it digitally — a pioneering development in the field.
“What iPad Pro has made possible, and what Alex and I are so excited about, is this level of integration and interaction with the data,” says Dr. Emmerson. “If I need to remember what Mary-Evelyn’s trench looked like on the morning of July 28, I can instantly access all of her artifacts, soil analysis, photos, drawings — all of it is right there at my fingertips.”
This January, Dr. Badillo and his colleagues will present the database and discuss the iPad Pro workflow that helped make it possible at the annual Archaeological Institute of America conference.
“In terms of success, the workflow with iPad Pro exceeded my expectations for how quickly we were able to get everything and everyone working together,” says Dr. Badillo. “I think it has a lot to do with the capabilities of iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, and how easy they are to use.”
This year’s dig was the first of three. During the next two summers, Emmerson will return with a team to continue to excavate the same area. But the next time she arrives, she will be looking at the site with new eyes.
“It’s looking like the building is a lot later than it was dated in the past,” says Dr. Emmerson, who spent the week after the dig poring over the data with her fellow archaeologists. “Based on everything we collected, especially the coin and the pottery we found, we’re now looking at a date probably in the middle of the first century C.E. And we’re also seeing improvements to the dining areas of the restaurant that lead us to believe that Pompeii was not a city in decline at the time of the eruption — it was thriving.”
Dr. Emmerson sees Apple products as crucial in helping her arrive at these answers, and in such a short period of time. Archaeological teams often don’t report findings until years after digs are finished.
“I understood the site better than I ever have at the end of an excavation — this is the cleanest and clearest archaeology I have ever done, and iPad Pro is such a huge part of that,” she says. “That’s one of the reasons why this technology is so vital — it lets us show exactly what we did and exactly what we found — because it’s incredibly important to me to live up to the responsibility of excavating a site like this and telling the stories of the people who lived here.”

2022-10-03,Increase,Celebrating 100 million songs,"Text of this article
October 3, 2022
UPDATE
Celebrating 100 million songs
Apple Music’s global head of editorial Rachel Newman answers the question: What’s in a number?
One hundred million songs.
Twenty-one years on from the invention of iTunes and the debut of the original iPod, we’ve gone from 1,000 songs in your pocket to 100,000x that on Apple Music. It’s phenomenal growth by any metric. The entire history, present, and future of music is at your fingertips or voice command.
More music than you can listen to in a lifetime, or several lifetimes. More music than any other platform. Simply the biggest collection of music, in any format, ever.
One hundred million songs — it’s a number that will continue to grow and exponentially multiply. But it’s more than just a number, representing something much more significant — the tectonic shift in the business of music making and distribution over these past two decades.
Back in the 1960s, only 5,000 new albums were released each year. Today, anywhere in the world, in 167 countries and regions on Apple Music, any artist of any description can write and record a song and release it globally. Every day, over 20,000 singers and songwriters are delivering new songs to Apple Music — songs that make our catalog even better than it wasthe day before. One hundred million songs is evidence of a more democratic space, where anyone, even a new artist making music out of their bedroom, can have the next big hit.
This isn’t just an opportunity to reflect on how far we’ve come, but also a moment to look forward to the work we have left to do. At Apple Music, human curation has always been the core to everything we do, both in ways you can see, like our editorial playlists; and ways you can’t, like the human touch that drives our recommendation algorithms. Now more than ever, we know that investment in human curation will be key in making us the very best at connecting artists and audiences.
With such a huge expanse of songs, we know you need someone there to guide you through. Gone are the days of hitting shuffle on your library: Now it’s on us to help you discover new favorites and rediscover forgotten gems, whether it’s one of our expert radio hosts lighting your path, or a handcrafted playlist.
We also know that it’s more important than ever that we are elevating artists’ voices and providing opportunities for them to tell their own stories and contextualize their music. It is no longer enough to just connect artists and fans, it’s about making those connections deeper and more meaningful. And just one of the many ways we are helping to provide context is through the newApple Music Todayseries, where we’ll be picking a new song every day and diving into its history, because we know that each of the 100 million songs in our catalog has its own story.
There’s never been a more exciting time to be a music fan. With 100 million songs on Apple Music, you can explore genres you never knew existed and find your new favorite artist in places you would never expect. So take a dive, andlet us guide you through.

UPDATE
Apple expands its Community Education Initiative, accelerating learning opportunities in more than 600 communities
With a focus on equity, Apple now works with more than 150 educational partners around the world to provide access to coding, creativity, and workforce opportunities
Several weeks ago, California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) welcomed more than 300 elementary and middle school students from across Los Angeles to its Center for Innovation in STEM Education (CISE) lab for a “STEAM Max” experience. The event gave participants from all backgrounds the opportunity to learn new science and technology skills — including app design. That same week, the university kicked off after-school coding clubs at six elementary and middle schools, and began hosting a regular Saturday STEM Exploration Day where activities are coached by CSUDH computer science majors.
CSUDH is part of Apple’s Community Education Initiative (CEI), which launched in 2019 to bring coding, creativity, and career opportunities to learners of all ages, and to communities that are traditionally underrepresented in technology. Since then, the company has rapidly expanded this work to learners across 99 countries and regions, and all 50 states, building on years of collaboration with educators and communities.
Through CEI, Apple teams up with schools, educational institutions, and community-based organizations to provide Apple hardware, scholarships, financial support, educator resources, and access to teams of Apple experts who work side by side with educators to enhance student learning with technology. Apple collaborates with each partner organization to customize and enhance programming to support the community’s goals, bringing together Apple’s unique combination of hardware, software, and professional learning resources to transform students’ in-school and extracurricular educational experiences.
In the two years since CSUDH first teamed up with Apple, the university has brought new STEAM experiences to nearly 2,000 students and teachers across greater Los Angeles — and expects to reach another 4,000 learners across 40 schools with programming this year. The university also helps educators obtain their certification in computer science instruction to ensure California has enough teachers for coding and IT workforce training classes.
“What astonishes me the most is what we’ve been able to accomplish in such a short period of time because of this unique partnership with Apple,” said Dr. Kamal Hamdan, director of CSUDH’s CISE lab. “Thousands of students who would have never had access to this type of learning have gone though one of our programs, and you can’t put a dollar amount on those experiences. It’s a testament to the fact that when two organizations with like-minded values put their hearts and their heads toward a common goal, the sky is the limit in terms of how many lives we can change.”
CSUDH’s ambitious growth plans are reflective of the ongoing expansion of Apple’s CEI work, as the company brings new programming and learning opportunities to more partners and learners across the US and globally. Apple kicked off its CEI programming with educators from nearly 70 educational institutions in Austin, Texas; Boise, Idaho; Columbus, Ohio; Houston; Nashville, Tennessee; and Northern California. Three years later, Apple now has CEI partners in 29 states, plus the District of Columbia. Through virtual and in-person programming, more than 150 partners have reached learners in nearly 600 communities across 99 countries and regions, and all 50 US states.
CEI is rooted in Apple’s four-decade history in education and its commitment to advancing equity and access through education. CEI partners serve communities that have historically been under-resourced, and the initiative is designed to create opportunities for learners who may not otherwise have access to technology or workforce resources. The work aligns with Apple’sRacial Equity and Justice Initiative, which in part aims to expand opportunities for communities of color through education. Through CEI, Apple works with K-12 schools to advance in-school learning, organizations that provide out-of-school programming — such as Boys & Girls Clubs of America and Kode With Klossy — and minority-serving institutions, including dozens of Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-Serving Institutions.
“We believe education is a powerful force for equity, helping learners discover the tools they need to lift up their communities and shape the future,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’re thrilled to continue to expand our Community Education Initiative so that students of all ages have access to world-class learning opportunities, regardless of their zip code.”
Oklahoma City University (OCU) — in partnership with the Cherokee Nation, the Choctaw Nation, and the Chickasaw Nation — is among Apple’s new CEI partners. Together, Apple, OCU, and the tribal governments have launched a new effort to provide educational opportunities to Native American youth and other young people who live on tribal reservations in Oklahoma, with the dual goals of preserving tribal languages and cultures, and enabling employment pathways so that young people can pursue their future while living in their tribal communities. The partnership kicks off later this month with a teacher academy for educators working in schools within the reservations of the Cherokee Nation, Choctaw Nation, and Chickasaw Nation, to support their work to integrate creativity and coding concepts in the classroom.
“I’m in awe of the relationship this university has developed with Apple and the impact it will have on our tribal nation partners,” said Kenneth Evans, OCU’s president. “Together, we have the tools, technology, strategic infrastructure, and preservation initiatives that are creating paths to opportunity for future generations. From coding to more broad technical skills, we’re helping young people prepare for in-demand jobs while still honoring the heritage, language, and traditions of the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw nations. As these programs expand, so too will their reach, enriching communities and preserving legacies for years to come.”
Since launching CEI four years ago, Apple has maintained a focus on supporting teachers and educators by providing cutting-edge professional learning opportunities in their communities, and expanding programming to dozens of new organizations from coast to coast. New partners include Arizona State University; Arts New Orleans; the Center for Black Educator Development in Philadelphia; Education Service Center Region 13 in Austin; the Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges; Harry S Truman College in Chicago; Henry Ford College in metro Detroit; Locally Grown Community Forge in Pittsburgh; Miami Dade College; Rutgers 4-H Computers Pathways Program in Newark, New Jersey; The New York Public Library TechConnect; University of Colorado Denver; University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Center for Youth Engagement; Wayne State University College of Engineering in Detroit; and more.

Meet seven Hispanic and Latin app creators breaking barriers with technology
Founders of Encantos, BiteSight, and Yana on their unexpected journeys to creating apps on the App Store
Often, a truly great app is a reflection of the people who built it. Entrepreneurs around the world are launching apps on the App Store to provide meaningful avenues for connection and empathy, make the world more inclusive and accessible for everyone, and honor their rich cultures and identities. The teams from Encantos, BiteSight, and Yana — comprised of Hispanic and Latin founders and developers — showcase how creativity combines with passion and skill to bring best-in-class apps to life.
ForEncantosco-founders Steven Wolfe Pereira and Susie Jaramillo, diverse representation has always been at the heart of their work. Earlier this year, Wolfe Pereira participated in the inaugural Apple Entrepreneur Camp for Hispanic and Latin founders. Encantos, the pair’s flagship app, offers a comprehensive children’s library featuring uplifting content and stories from creators around the world.Canticos— the company’s first app — is now the top bilingual preschool app on the App Store, and provides an interactive way for young children to dive into the Spanish language and Latin heritage.
As part of the first cohort of students at the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, teammates Alejandra A. Enriquez, Juan A. Rubio, Gabe Martinez, and Joshua Gomez collaborated to create an app that puts accessibility at the forefront. Though they all come from different backgrounds, their drive to help others brought them together to launchBiteSight— an app that helps people who are blind or low vision quickly scan and identify food allergens on product ingredient labels — on the App Store. The app also uses haptic feedback and VoiceOver to alert users of allergens they’ve identified, helping blind and low-vision users gain more independence in their daily lives.
Andrea Campos, the creator ofYana, first began working on her chatbot-based app as a side project that combined her two interests — coding and wellness. Yana is designed to tackle negative thoughts linked to anxiety and depression, and focuses on providing access to mental health tools for Spanish-speaking people. The inspiration came from her own childhood struggles with mental health and her desire to offer a widely accessible resource in Spanish. The app climbed from 80,000 downloads to over 1 million after being featured on the App Store at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Below, the founders of these app companies share how their personal experiences have fueled their passion for helping others and enabled them to turn a simple idea into an app that can reach millions of users around the world.
Merging Creativity and Technology
Susie Jaramillo (SJ), CEO and co-founder of Encantos:I never could have imagined I would be using technology as a digital canvas to bring immersive story experiences to life for millions of kids. I also couldn’t possibly have known that what I took for granted — my community and my culture — would direct my career in the way that they have, becoming both the source of inspiration and the source of opportunity. I’m an artist and a storyteller. I remember when the first-generation iPad came out, my eyes lit up with the story experience possibilities for kids. Analog media can be so limiting in reach, but with an app, you can put something beautiful together and it can be immersive, interactive, and reach millions all at once.
Steven Wolfe Pereira (SWP), chairman and co-founder of Encantos:We’ve always believed in the power of technology to help bring our stories and characters to life. Encantos was founded by two Latino families focused on creating culturally authentic entertainment for kids and families. Everything is driven by technology today, so technology plays an incredibly important role in helping to preserve, recognize, and celebrate the cultural contributions of Hispanic and Latino people.
Infusing Personal Experiences into App Development
Andrea Campos (AC), founder and CEO of Yana:The nature of depression is feeling like you are alone in the world. I swore I was the only human being who felt like that when I was a teenager. It wasn’t until I pitched Yana for the first time that I saw the reaction from the audience and realized I was not the only one. After coming out of the “mental health closet,” dozens of people I’ve known my whole life came forward to talk about what they had been experiencing as well. With Yana, I want to empower people with emotional education through a safe, judgment-free zone where they can change the way they feel by learning to change the way they think.
SWP:Encantos comes from a deeply personal need to be seen. My mother was Dominican and my father was American. I grew up in a bilingual household where we spoke Spanish at home after speaking English everywhere else. The only time I got to see my Latino culture was when we would visit the Dominican Republic. It always struck me as odd that growing up in New York City where there was such diversity, you would never see any culturally authentic Latino products, ranging from shows on TV to goods in a store. Becoming a parent changes you, and you reach a point in your life where you have to be the change you want to see in the world.
SJ:As a Latina mom raising little ones here in the US, I wanted to pass on my language and my love of my Latino culture to my kids. And at the time, there really wasn’t much available for moms like me facing this challenge. As we thought about how to tackle this, we realized the one thing you always have on you is your phone. It made complete sense when we came up with the idea for the world of Canticos that it had to all come together in the form of the app. It was the one place where we could have all of the apps, music, and singalong videos together in one place, but in two languages.
Joining Forces with Like-Minded Innovators
Alejandra A. Enriquez (AAE), lead iOS developer and designer of BiteSight:Our team consists of six people, including myself, and those five people I’ve collaborated with for about 10 weeks have been the most motivational, hardworking, and supportive people I have met. We named our team “Powerhouse” due to an Apple Developer Academy mentor calling us that, and she was right. We are a powerhouse team.
Gabe Martinez (GM), iOS developer, lead project manager, and business of BiteSight:I owned a convenience store in southwest Detroit, but due to the pandemic, I needed to make a change. So I jumped all the way into the Apple Developer Academy. The Apple Developer Academy gave me the power to believe that an idea can be transformed into an app. I changed gears with the App Academy overnight, and I feel like this is what I was always trying to do. And finally it’s coming true. So it’s like a dream coming through.
SWP:We work with diverse creators around the world who are looking to tell culturally authentic stories on Encantos to empower kids. Creators are at the heart of Encantos, and we hope our success to date inspires creators around the world to pursue their dreams.
Being a part of Apple’s inaugural Entrepreneur Camp for Hispanic and Latin founders was truly a dream come true. To have access to Apple engineers, UX designers, product managers, marketers, and execs was just incredible. It wasn’t just one or two people — it was a true cross-functional team that would meet with us every day, and we all learned so much. Whether it was getting direct feedback on user interface improvements to learning how to tell our story in the “Apple” way, it was just a phenomenal program that has made Encantos a better developer and a better company.
Prioritizing Impact
Juan A. Rubio (JAR), iOS developer, UX/UI designer, and marketing of BiteSight:I have a passion for using tech to make someone’s everyday life more convenient and independent. After months of research, I found out the US didn’t have many studies or resources around visually impaired people and how they are buying their food. This became a genuine concern to me. I kept asking myself,Why are there limited resources for visually impaired people with dietary restrictions?
After going through the challenge-based learning process at the Developer Academy, my team and I came up with the idea of giving someone the power to see through their phone. The functionality of just being able to search and read Live Text can be used by anyone to search for any text. I believe that technology can serve as that extra safety net for people who don’t or can’t always rely on another person for assistance.
AC:Many folks in the Latinx community and beyond aren’t equipped with the emotional resources to deal with struggles and day-to-day challenges they face in life. Due to this lack, people seek to solve their problems through nonprofessional help that ends up being insufficient. Apart from that, they also often end up feeling ignored, misunderstood, insecure, and judged. The Latinx and Hispanic population is the largest ethnic minority group in the US, but data reports that less than 10 percent of them have access to mental health services. While there are a number of reasons why this is — insurance, legal status, cultural stigma — the language barrier for some individuals is what makes accessing mental health services challenging. That’s part of the reason why we decided to launch in Spanish.

Apple introduces Ask Apple for developers
New series of interactive Q&As and one-on-ones provide developers with direct access to Apple experts
Apple today introducedAsk Apple, a new series of interactive Q&As and one-on-one consultations that will provide developers with even more opportunities to connect directly with Apple experts for insight, support, and feedback.
Developers participating in Ask Apple can inquire about a variety of topics, such as testing on the latest seeds; implementing new and updated frameworks from Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC); adopting new features like the Dynamic Island; moving to Swift, SwiftUI, and accessibility; and preparing their apps for new OS and hardware releases. Ask Apple is free of charge and registration is open to all members of the Apple Developer Program and the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.
This series will enable developers to ask questions to various Apple team members through Q&As on Slack or in one-on-one office hours. Q&As allow developers to connect with Apple evangelists, engineers, and designers to get their questions answered, share their learnings, and engage with other developers around the world. Office hours are focused on creating and distributing compelling apps that take advantage of the latest in technology and design. Developers can ask for code-level assistance, design guidance, input on implementing technologies and frameworks, advice on resolving issues, or help with App Review Guidelines and distribution tools. Office hours will be hosted in time zones around the world and in multiple languages.
“We’ve been listening to feedback from developers around the world about what will be most helpful to them as they build innovative apps, and we’ve seen an increased appetite for one-on-one support and conversation with Apple experts,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Enterprise and Education Marketing. “Our team is committed to continuously evolving our support for our diverse global developer community, and we’re excited to offer Ask Apple as another new resource.”
Ask Apple builds on successful programs like Tech Talks and Meet with App Store Experts, which have offered developers more than 200 live presentations and thousands of office hours over the past year.
Jordi Bruin, an iOS developer from Amsterdam, has launched over 20 apps on the App Store and has attended more than 50 Apple developer sessions and labs including Tech Talks and during Apple’s annual WWDC. One of his latest apps,Posture Pal, aims to help users improve their posture by leveraging the motion sensors in AirPods. He recounts how his conversations with Apple experts guided him on his app-building and refinement process.
“Early on in the development of Posture Pal, I attended a Tech Talk focused on the motion sensors in the AirPods. I spoke to a technology evangelist who not only helped me understand the parameters and possibilities of the technology, but who also helped me brainstorm more advanced features and use cases that I had not considered before,” said Bruin. “A designer at Apple also did a complete rundown of Posture Pal’s onboarding experience, highlighting the aspects that could be improved. Based on the feedback, I removed redundant information and simplified the design of key screens in the app. Hearing from an expert in UX design has helped me in coming up with design guidelines for my projects overall.”
Ondine Bullot is the CEO of Better Kids and the founder of educational appWisdom: The World of Emotions, which teaches young children social and emotional skills like managing feelings and resolving conflict through games and augmented reality (AR). Bullot and her team members from around the world have participated in multiple engagement series including Tech Talks, Meet with App Store Experts, and WWDC’s digital lounge discussions.
“I vividly remember attending one-on-one office hours. It was one of the most creative sessions in terms of imagining new features and use cases for our app. One idea that emerged, which we are currently working on, is integrating Siri to our app so kids can say ‘Hey Siri, I need help with my emotions,’ which would prompt Wisdom — our app's main character — to guide them through different calming strategies,” Bullot said. “Our app offers a plethora of content: interactive games, AR, guided meditations, practice activities, printables, parenting tips, teaching resources. Thanks to Apple experts’ feedback, we recently redesigned our app’s navigation to create separate paths for children, educators, and parents which helped clarify which resources are relevant to each one of them. We also redesigned our meditation section to make it more visual and user-friendly for children.”
Ask Apple will be an ongoing series, with the first round of opportunities coming October 17-21. Current members of the Apple Developer Program and the Apple Developer Enterprise Program can register and find information on the schedule by visitingdeveloper.apple.com/events/ask-apple.
In addition to the Ask Apple series, hundreds of hours of sessions are available on demand on the Apple Developer website and in theApple Developer app, enabling developers to hear directly from Apple about the latest technologies and important news all in one place, all year long, whenever and wherever is most convenient. Developers can access a robust library of timely, relevant, and practical content from Apple experts and engineers, including news about everything from API and framework changes to Apple’s human interface guidelines, program announcements, and technical articles, as well as a technical and design video library. Apple also offers all members of the Apple Developer Program the opportunity to receive one-on-one code-level support with technical support engineers who can help troubleshoot an app’s code or bring solutions to fast-track development.
Apple provides a wide variety of cutting-edge tools and end-to-end support for developers to build, test, market, and distribute their apps to more than 1.5 billion Apple devices. An extensive suite of free tools and frameworks — including software development kits (SDKs) and developer services with more than 250,000 APIs — support developers building apps for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. These tools enable developers to add new functionalities to their apps easily and quickly, and harness powerful capabilities like machine learning, AR, and many more. Programs such as Apple’s Developer Academies, Entrepreneur Camps, App Accelerators, and WWDC student scholarships, as well as open access tools like Everyone Can Code and Swift Playgrounds, ensure the power of coding technology is accessible and inclusive.
The App Store, which launched in 2008, is the world’s safest and most vibrant app marketplace, currently home to 1.8 million apps and visited by more than half a billion people each week across 175 regions. It helps creators, dreamers, and learners of all ages and backgrounds connect with the tools and information they need to build a brighter future and a better world.For more information on developing for the App Store, visitapple.com/app-store/developing-for-the-app-store.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces next-generation iPad Pro, supercharged by the M2 chip
The new iPad Pro features a next-level Apple Pencil hover experience, ProRes video capture, superfast Wi-Fi 6E, and powerful features in iPadOS 16
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the newiPad Prowith the M2 chip, delivering the ultimate combination of portability, versatility, and unbelievable performance. The new iPad Pro features a next-level Apple Pencil hover experience and superfast wireless connectivity, along with the world’s most advanced mobile display, pro cameras, Face ID, Thunderbolt, and a four-speaker audio system. New features in iPadOS 16 — including Stage Manager, full external display support,1desktop-class apps, and Reference Mode — take pro workflows on iPad even further. Enabled by its advanced hardware and iPadOS 16, iPad Pro has an incredible ecosystem of powerful pro apps unlike any other device of its kind. The new iPad Pro is available to order starting today, and in stores beginning Wednesday, October 26.
“The next-generation iPad Pro pushes the boundaries of what’s possible on iPad, bringing even more versatility, power, and portability to the ultimate iPad experience,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Powered by the M2 chip, the new iPad Pro features incredible performance and the most advanced technologies, including a next-level Apple Pencil hover experience, ProRes video capture, superfast wireless connectivity, and powerful iPadOS 16 features. There’s nothing else like it.”
Breakthrough Performance from the M2 Chip
M2, the start of Apple’s next generation of M-series chips, brings even more breakthrough performance and capabilities to iPad Pro, with industry-leading power efficiency, a unified memory architecture, and custom technologies.
M2 features an 8-core CPU — up to 15 percent faster than M1 — with advancements in both performance and efficiency cores, and a 10-core GPU, delivering up to 35 percent faster graphics performance for the most demanding users. Combined with the CPU and GPU, the 16-core Neural Engine can process 15.8 trillion operations per second — 40 percent more than M1 — making iPad Pro even more powerful when handling machine learning tasks. The M2 chip also features 100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth — 50 percent more than M1 — and supports up to 16GB of fast unified memory, making multitasking and working with large assets even more fluid.2
The performance of M2 turbocharges even the most demanding workflows, from photographers editing massive photo libraries and designers manipulating complex 3D objects, to healthcare professionals taking advanced imaging and analysis, to gamers enjoying graphics-intensive games. The power of M2 also extends to the new media engine and the image signal processor, which combined with the advanced cameras, enable users to capture ProRes video for the first time and transcode ProRes footage up to 3x faster. This means content creators can capture, edit, and publish cinema-grade video from a single device out in the field.
A Next-Level Apple Pencil Hover Experience
Powered by the new iPad Pro and iPadOS 16, hover with Apple Pencil (2nd generation) provides a completely new dimension for users to interact with their screen. Apple Pencil is now detected up to 12 mm above the display, allowing users to see a preview of their mark before they make it. This also allows users to sketch and illustrate with even greater precision, and makes everything users do with Apple Pencil even more effortless. For example, with Scribble, text fields automatically expand when the pencil gets near the screen, and handwriting converts to text even faster. Third-party apps can also take advantage of this new feature to enable entirely new marking and drawing experiences.
Superfast Wireless Connectivity
The new iPad Pro supports the fastest Wi-Fi connections with support for Wi-Fi 6E,3so users who need fast connections can take their demanding workflows with them everywhere. Downloads are up to 2.4Gb/s, 2x faster than the previous generation. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G (sub-6GHz and mmWave4) now support more 5G networks around the world, so users can access their files, communicate with colleagues, and back up their data in a snap while on the go.5
Unmatched Pro Features Enabled by iPadOS 16
In addition to big updates to Messages, new tools in Mail and Safari, the new Weather app, and more ways to interact with photos and video with Live Text and Visual Look Up, iPadOS 16 also introduces powerful productivity features that elevate the iPad Pro experience:
iPad and the Environment
The new iPad models are designed to minimize their impact on the environment and include 100 percent recycled gold — a first for iPad — in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards, as well as recycled aluminum, tin, and rare earth elements. All iPad models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are mercury-, BFR-, PVC-, and beryllium-free. Redesigned packaging in the new iPad Pro eliminates the outer plastic wrap, and 99 percent of the packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.

Fitness+ subscribers without Apple TV can use AirPlay to stream workouts or meditations on compatible third-party devices, and all AirPlay-enabled Roku devices will see onscreen metrics for additional motivation next month.
Fitness+ users with an Apple Watch can continue to take their motivation to the next level with personalized real-time metrics that display on iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV, as well as the ability to experience Time to Walk, Time to Run, and meditations with just their Apple Watch paired with Bluetooth-enabled headphones.
Artist Spotlight with Taylor Swift
Starting October 24, music by Taylor Swift will be available in the service for the first time ever, beginning with a dedicated solo Artist Spotlight series featuring newly released songs from her album “Midnights,” out October 21. The series dedicates an entire workout playlist to a single artist, and every Monday for three weeks, new workouts featuring music by Taylor Swift will appear across workout types including Core, Cycling, Dance, HIIT, Pilates, Rowing, Strength, Treadmill, and Yoga.
To celebrate the theme of “Midnights,” the first three workouts will feature special themed lighting, and the Fitness+ trainers will highlight the artist in fun and creative ways. In a Treadmill workout, the first letter of each coaching tip by Fitness+ trainer Scott Carvin will combine to spell “SWIFTIE.” In a HIIT workout, Fitness+ trainer Anja Garcia will coach users through 13-second intervals to lean into Swift’s affinity for the number 13.
Yoga for Every Runner with Scott Jurek
Cross-training is essential to runners of all levels, as it may help improve speed and strength, and help prevent injury. Fitness+ will introduce a new workout program, Yoga for Every Runner, featuring and designed with Scott Jurek, one of the world’s top ultramarathon athletes and an author, and led by Fitness+ Yoga trainer Jessica Skye. Inspired by Scott’s approach and integration of yoga, this program is designed to improve running posture, balance, and mobility. Users can do each 10-minute Yoga flow as a warmup, a recovery stretch, or mixed with other workouts from the Fitness+ library. As with all Fitness+ studio workouts, modifications are shown so users can enjoy the workouts at their own level.
“Throughout my running career, I have pushed my body and mind to new limits by running longer distances and exploring trails and roads around the world. Having optimal strength, flexibility, stability, and balance is crucial to running efficiently, and yoga is one of the many ways I get the most out of my body and become a more holistic runner,” said Jurek. “Whether people are new to running or seasoned veterans, I hope these 10-minute workouts in this program on Fitness+ will help users feel more confident and comfortable incorporating yoga into their training and recovery.”
Workout programs on Fitness+ — such as Workouts for Beginners, Workouts for Older Adults, Stay Active During Pregnancy, and Get Ready for Snow Season — feature custom content designed to support users through a season of life or help them prepare for important moments.
Time to Walk
Starting on October 24, Fitness+ will also introduce new episodes of Time to Walk, beginning with Hannah Waddingham. Time to Walk is an inspiring audio experience on iPhone and Apple Watch, designed to help people walk more often, featuring some of the world’s most interesting and influential people who share stories, photos, and music with Fitness+ users. Waddingham is known for her performances on the West End, garnering three Olivier Award nominations, and more recently, she rose to mainstream fame for her Emmy-winning role as Rebecca Welton on Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso.” On this walk, Waddingham shares how being championed by a legendary director at just the right moment in her career renewed her faith in her own abilities, and how playing Rebecca brought healing after her own difficulties in life. Additional guests throughout the season will include globally renowned singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor and former astronaut and colonel Eileen M. Collins.
Collections
Additionally, Fitness+ will introduce three new Collections, curated content from the Fitness+ library to help users go after their goals or find inspiration, including:
More Ways to Get Started with Fitness+
This year, Fitness+ will offer new ways to sign up for the service at no additional cost through offers with SilverSneakers, Target, UnitedHealthcare, and Mobile Health.

2022-10-24,Increase,macOS Ventura is now available,"Text of this article
October 24, 2022
UPDATE
macOS Ventura is now available
macOS Ventura takes the Mac experience to a whole new level with groundbreaking capabilities that help users achieve more than ever. New features like Continuity Camera enable users to seamlessly work across their Apple devices, and productivity tools including Stage Manager help users stay focused and easily move between tasks. Safari ushers in a passwordless future with passkeys, and big updates come to popular apps including Mail and Messages.macOS Venturais available today as a free software update on Macs with Apple silicon and Intel-based Macs.1
Continuity Makes Apple Devices Work Magically Together
With Continuity Camera, Mac users can leverage the powerful camera system on iPhone to unleash a groundbreaking webcam experience.2When iPhone is nearby, Mac can automatically recognize and use the camera on iPhone to unlock new capabilities that were never possible before on a webcam, and even works wirelessly for greater flexibility. Desk View taps into the Ultra Wide camera on iPhone to simultaneously show the user’s face and an overhead view of their desk — great for DIY videos, hands-on presentations, and so much more. Continuity Camera also brings innovative features like Center Stage, Portrait mode, and the new Studio Light — an effect that beautifully illuminates a user’s face while dimming the background — to all Mac computers.3
Handoff now comes to FaceTime, so users can start a FaceTime call on one Apple device and seamlessly transfer the call to another Apple device nearby. A user can start a FaceTime call on their iPhone or iPad and move the call to their Mac when they get back to their home or office, or they could even start a call on their Mac and transition it to their iPhone or iPad when they are on the go.
Automatically Organize Workspaces with Stage Manager
Stage Manager automatically organizes apps and windows so users can concentrate on the task at hand and still see everything in a single glance. When users enable Stage Manager from Control Center, the current window they are working in is displayed prominently in the center, while other windows appear on the left so they can seamlessly switch between tasks. To create the ideal workspace, users can create groups of windows or apps when working on specific tasks or projects. Stage Manager also works in concert with macOS windowing tools including Mission Control and Spaces, and users can easily access their desktop with a single click.
Passkeys and New Collaboration Tools in Safari
Safari ushers in a passwordless future with passkeys — a new sign-in method that makes browsing in Safari even safer. Passkeys are more secure, easy to use, and are designed to replace passwords. Whenever users create a passkey, a unique digital key is created that stays on device and is never stored on a web server, so hackers can’t leak them or trick users into sharing them. With passkeys, it’s easy for users to sign in securely using Touch ID or Face ID for biometric verification, and passkeys are securely synced with end-to-end encryption using iCloud Keychain so they are available across Apple devices including Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Passkeys also work across apps and the web, and users can even sign in to websites or apps on non-Apple devices using their iPhone.
Shared Tab Groups in Safari introduce a powerful way to collaborate with others on the web. Users can easily share websites with family, friends, and colleagues, and see what tabs others are looking at live. Users can also build a list of bookmarks on a shared Start Page to help kickstart any group project — whether it’s planning a family vacation or completing a research paper — and users can even start a Messages conversation or FaceTime call with everyone in the group, right from Safari.
Boost Efficiency with New Mail Improvements
Mail gives users the ability to schedule messages, cancel delivery of a message before it reaches a recipient’s inbox,4and even add rich links for better content previews. Mail can also detect if items such as an attachment or cc’d recipient is missing and remind the sender to add them. Users can even set reminders to come back to a message later and get automatic suggestions to follow up on emails when they are waiting on a response.
Search in Mail uses state-of-the-art techniques to deliver more accurate and complete results. It’s easy for users to quickly find what they are looking for as soon as they click into search, including recent emails, contacts, documents, photos, and more, all before they even start typing.
Powerful Enhancements to Messages
Users can edit or undo a recently sent message,5recover accidentally deleted messages, or even mark a message as unread if they are unable to respond in the moment. Collaborating with others is easier than ever as users now have the option to share a file in Messages and automatically give everyone on the thread access. Activity updates appear at the top of the thread as everyone goes in and makes edits to the shared document. Users can also quickly join SharePlay sessions from their Mac right in Messages, so they can chat while participating in shared experiences like watching a show or listening to a song together.
Effortlessly Share Photos with Family through iCloud Shared Photo Library
iCloud Shared Photo Library enables users to create and share a separate photo library among up to six family members, so everyone can enjoy all of their family photos. It’s easy for users to either share all of their existing photos from their personal libraries, or share based on a start date or the people in their photos. Users will receive intelligent suggestions to share photo moments that include participants in the library and any other people they choose. And every user can add, delete, edit, or favorite the shared photos and videos, which will appear in each user’s Memories and Featured Photos so that everyone can relive more complete family moments.
Spotlight Brings Improved Productivity
Spotlight comes with new features and an updated design that provides a more consistent experience across Mac, iPhone, and iPad. Users can now use Spotlight to find images in their photo library, on the web, and across the system in apps like Messages and Notes. They can even search for their photos by location, people, scenes, or objects, and Live Text lets them search by text inside images. Spotlight also includes rich results for categories for artists, movies, actors, TV shows, businesses, and sports. To take their productivity even further, users can take actions from Spotlight to do things like start a timer or create a new document. And with support for Quick Look in Spotlight, users can quickly see a full-size preview of nearly any kind of file without having to open it.
Gaming on Mac Reaches New Heights
The power of Apple silicon enables every new Mac to run AAA games with ease, and macOS Ventura brings new technologies like Metal 3 that take full advantage of the incredible hardware in Mac — resulting in faster performance, games that feel more responsive, and graphics that look stunning.
New AAA game titles are coming to Mac later this year, including Capcom’s Resident Evil Village, which will launch on the Mac App Store on Friday, October 28, and will take full advantage of the power and performance of Apple silicon for more responsive gameplay, high frame rates, and beautiful visuals.
Additional Features

2022-10-25,Increase,Apple calls on global supply chain to decarbonize by 2030,"Text of this article
October 25, 2022
UPDATE
Apple calls on global supply chain to decarbonize by 2030
The company accelerates work with suppliers to decarbonize Apple-related production, and expands investments in clean energy and climate solutions around the world
Apple today called on its global supply chain to take new steps to address their greenhouse gas emissions and take a comprehensive approach to decarbonization. The company will evaluate the work of its major manufacturing partners to decarbonize their Apple-related operations — including running on 100 percent renewable electricity — and will track yearly progress. Apple has been carbon neutral for its global corporate operations since 2020, and is laser-focused on its ambitious goal to become carbon neutral across its entire global supply chain and the life cycle of every product.
As the impacts of climate change are increasingly felt around the world, Apple also announced new initiatives and investments aimed at helping decarbonize the global economy and promote innovative climate solutions for communities. These include significant investments in renewable energy in Europe, partnerships to support businesses transitioning to clean energy, and new support for projects that advance natural carbon removal and community-driven climate solutions around the world.
“Fighting climate change remains one of Apple’s most urgent priorities, and moments like this put action to those words,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re looking forward to continued partnership with our suppliers to make Apple’s supply chain carbon neutral by 2030. Climate action at Apple doesn’t stop at our doors, and in this work, we’re determined to be a ripple in the pond that creates a bigger change.”
Mobilizing Supply Chain Climate Action
As part of Apple’s supplier engagement, the company is partnering with its worldwide supply chain to urge accelerated action to achieve carbon neutrality for their Apple-related corporate operations. The company requires reporting on progress toward these goals — specifically Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reductions related to Apple production — and will track and audit annual progress. Apple will partner with suppliers that are working with urgency and making measurable progress toward decarbonization.
Additionally, Apple is encouraging suppliers to address the greenhouse gas emissions beyond their Apple production, prioritizing clean energy. As part of the company’s work to achieve its 2030 goal, Apple has reduced its emissions by 40 percent since 2015, largely through improvements in energy efficiency, low-carbon design, becoming carbon neutral for corporate operations, and transitioning its supply chain to renewable electricity.
More than 200 suppliers representing more than 70 percent of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend have already committed to using clean power like wind or solar for all Apple production. Major manufacturing partners — including Corning Incorporated, Nitto Denko Corporation, SK hynix, STMicroelectronics, TSMC, and Yuto — have committed to power all Apple production with 100 percent renewable energy.
To help suppliers meet their commitments and go even further, Apple offers a suite of free e-learning resources and live trainings through its Clean Energy Program, and works closely with its suppliers and local partners to identify effective solutions for renewable energy and carbon removal. More than 150 supplier representatives have participated in live trainings this year alone. Apple plans to donate these resources to create a first-of-its-kind public training platform that is free for businesses across many different industries, ensuring that companies of all sizes — in Apple’s supply chain and beyond — will have access to the resources and advocacy networks needed to speed their transition to 100 percent clean energy and carbon neutrality.
Expanding Clean Energy to Address Customer Product Use
As part of Apple’s commitment to clean energy, the company has sourced renewable energy to power all of its corporate offices, retail stores, and data centers in 44 countries since 2018, and its suppliers have brought more than 10 gigawatts of clean power online around the world. Building on this progress, Apple plans to facilitate the construction of large-scale solar and wind projects in Europe, with projects ranging between 30 and 300 megawatts — following an initial request for proposals issued earlier this year. Over the next several years, the company aims to procure enough renewable energy to power all Apple devices on the continent with low-carbon electricity, while continuing to power corporate offices, retail stores, and data centers with 100 percent clean energy. In total, the planned investments will add 3,000 gigawatt hours per year of new renewable energy on the grid.
The European investments are part of the company’s larger strategy to address the approximately 22 percent of its carbon footprint that comes from the electricity customers use to charge their devices. Wherever possible, Apple plans to bring clean energy projects online in grids with high carbon intensity, enhancing the impact on Europe’s electricity sector at a time when renewable generation is critically needed. Earlier this year, the company announced new renewable energy projects in theUnited StatesandAustraliadesigned to address customer product use.
Customers in the United States can now play a role in decreasing the carbon footprint of iPhone with Clean Energy Charging. Available starting this month in the United States through iOS 16, the new feature looks at the sources of the electricity during expected charge times and optimizes for when the grid is using cleaner energy sources like solar or wind. To continue to advance climate-smart decision-making for customers, employees, and partners, Apple has joined the University of California, Berkeley’sCoolClimate Network, a research partnership to motivate and empower individuals and organizations to make low-carbon choices.
Advancing Equitable and Financially Viable Climate Solutions Around the World
Apple today also announced three new projects through the Restore Fund, a first-of-its-kind carbon removal initiative that aims to generate a financial return while removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In partnership with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, Apple has invested with three high-quality forestry managers in Brazil and Paraguay to restore 150,000 acres of sustainably certified working forests and protect around 100,000 acres of native forests, grasslands, and wetlands.
Together, these initial forestry projects are forecast to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in 2025. To ensure accurate monitoring, reporting, and verification of the projects’ carbon removal impact, Apple is working with partners to analyze satellite imagery and deploy innovative remote sensing technologies.
As Apple continues to make progress reducing emissions by 75 percent by 2030, the company prioritizes high-quality nature-based solutions for the 25 percent of remaining emissions that are unavoidable with existing technologies. At the same time, Apple is working to spur entirely new solutions, including through support for analysis by Carbon Direct identifying pathways for developing sustainable aviation fuels.
In addition to the Restore Fund projects, Apple today announced new partnerships to advance community-driven climate solutions around the world:

Seven App Store creators share their tips for forging a career in coding
It often starts with a spark — a fledgling curiosity that develops into a more dedicated interest and then slowly grows into an all-consuming passion for solving unique problems and forging long-lasting connections in an entirely new language.
For some app developers, this spark was ignited in school by an encouraging teacher or parent, while others came to coding later in life, driven by an innate desire to pull things apart and understand how they work.
Ahead of National STEAM Day on November 8, seven inspiring creators — from college roommates who bonded over their love of sneakers to a pair of engineers looking to help fellow moms find quality childcare — are sharing their unique journeys that led them to entrepreneurship through app development and the App Store. Below, they offer insights for those looking to take the leap into coding and underline the endless opportunities available for aspiring app developers at all stages of life.
Anne K. Halsall (2022 Apple Entrepreneur Camp participant), co-founder and chief product officer atWinnie, a childcare discovery platform that helps parents find high-quality daycares and preschools“When I was a kid, computer-assisted artwork and computer design were the things I spent all my time doing; I was just obsessed. What was strange for me was that that was always like a hobby — something I pursued for fun, kind of in the privacy of my home. I didn’t have opportunities to bond with other kids about this, because I didn’t know any other girls who were into computers. And when I went to college, it never occurred to me to do this as a career. I didn’t even consider going into technology as a career, despite having computers in my life since I was very young. I, of course, ended up there because it was meant to be. It was the thing I wanted to do and the thing I was passionate about. So as much as I tried to do other things with my life, I ended up in technology inevitably, in spite of myself.”







































Amanda Southworth (2017 and 2018 WWDC Student Scholar), founder and executive director ofAstra Laboratories, a nonprofit that develops technology solutions that offer vital resources to marginalized communities
“I created my first app, AnxietyHelper, and I thought it was going to be just a thing I might talk about on college applications. I thought, ‘I kinda like mobile development, but I’m going to move back to robotics. I’m going to go to college.’ But I ended up doing none of those things. With AnxietyHelper, I put out something I knew had a need because I was experiencing that need. The response has and still is completely overwhelming; it was a really beautiful thing that came out of a lot of struggle and strength. It was very pivotal to understand that there are a lot of forms of action someone can take, and varying degrees of impact. App development is my platform, like how some people write poetry, or how some people make movies. The way I communicate and the way I process emotions is through app development.""
Sara Mauskopf, co-founder and CEO of Winnie“I always tell people you’re never too old to learn to code. I discovered it in college, and I thought I was already behind because some people at my college had learned to code in high school, but it turns out you can learn anytime, even much later in your career. At Winnie, we’re really supportive of hiring people from nontraditional backgrounds, like parents returning to the workforce, or people who see coding as a new career path after their first career.”

Akshaya Dinesh (2018 WWDC Student Scholar), founder and CEO ofSpellbound, a tool that allows companies to embed interactive user experiences directly into their marketing emails“When I was in high school, I started a nonprofit in my free time, and we had this really awesome team of young women who were passionate about making change in the industry; we were organizing everything from workshops for middle school girls to learn about coding, all the way up to hackathons of our own. We hosted one of the largest all-women hackathons in New York City and brought hundreds of people from across the area. People even flew in from across the country to come and participate and build their own products and apps. It’s been really awesome to see a community flourish.”
Nicco Adams (2021 Apple Entrepreneur Camp participant), co-founder ofKickstroid, a discovery app using machine learning to help sneaker enthusiasts discover their next favorite pair“I grew up in a predominantly Black community where not many people were pursuing STEAM. So you have this small collective that started in high school where, for the first time, I saw people who looked like me in this space. These are the pioneers of our future, the ones that will go on to design how this world will look and how we’ll interact with it. They’re alright with being vulnerable, taking the path less traveled to truly make their mark in this world. So you know, I looked at them and thought, ‘I should go ahead and jump into this space’ — a space where it doesn’t matter if you’re the teacher or the student; everyone learns from one another.”
“The biggest piece of advice I have for female founders and entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups is confidence. You know, there are so many people who are less underrepresented than us, and they’re able to get by just by seeming super, super confident and believing in themselves. I think that’s the first step to getting others to believe in you — having the faith that you can do it too. Even if you don’t have that confidence at first, pretend like you’re the most confident version of yourself as possible. That has worked incredible wonders for me, in terms of everything from raising venture capital to hiring employees — anything regarding bringing people around to believing in my vision. Confidence has been the first step.” — Akshaya Dinesh

Alandis Seals, junior developer and assistant instructor atEd Farm,a nonprofit and Apple Community Education Initiative partner that encourages kids and adults to pursue careers in STEAM
“I had an instructor who taught me how to code, and he was kind of my mentor at first. I’d come ask some questions and he was so responsive — if he didn’t know something, he’d jump on a Zoom with me and we’d try to figure it out, even if it took hours. We’d try to figure out any little problem I had, and that brought me to the point where now I can help pass on the language. He did that for me, and I have to do it for the next generation. I want to be that person who provides that same kind of help.”
David Alston (2021 Apple Entrepreneur Camp participant), co-founder and CEO of Kickstroid“Whatever someone does for you, do it twofold for the people behind you. Whatever they give you, don’t hold it just for yourself. It was shared with you with the intention that it’s also going to be shared with others to help build a community of people with interests like us, and who look like us and come from backgrounds like ours. That’s how we build a generation of innovators who look like us. Knowledge is not only yours; knowledge is meant to be shared. Knowledge is meant to be cultivated, improved, and passed down to the people behind us.”
“What’s important to me today is to be able to provide examples to kids that there are women in this field, that there are women who go to school for computer science, that there are women who have professional careers in programming and the digital world. Because when I was young, I didn’t really have the benefit of that. I think that’s the best explanation I can come up with for why I didn’t initially choose technology as a career. I think it’s very important for us to be examples of professional women in this field, so that other little girls can see themselves, too.” — Anne K. Halsall
“It’s been now six and a half years of building Winnie, and we built it kind of throughout our childbearing years. It wasn’t really an option for us to wait to have kids till after we were done with our startup because this is a long journey. And if you’re successful, this is a 10-plus-year journey you’re on. If you want to wait till your kids are grown, you’re letting a lot of time and opportunity pass you by.” — Sara Mauskopf

UPDATE
Bad Bunny is Apple Music’s Artist of the Year for 2022
Global recording artist Bad Bunny was announced today as Apple Music’s Artist of the Year, in acknowledgement of the musician’s artistic excellence and influence on global culture in 2022. So many of music’s biggest stars released amazing music in 2022 — one truly owned the year. Released this past May,Un Verano Sin Ti, the artist’s sixth project in four years, is Apple Music’s most streamed album of 2022 and now the biggest Latin album of all time. And beyond the eye-popping numbers, Bad Bunny has truly ushered in a seismic shift in global pop over the past few years.
“We’re thrilled to celebrate the achievements of Bad Bunny, whose influence on every corner of culture could not be ignored in 2022,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “Watching Bad Bunny ascend from an Apple Music Up Next artist in 2018 to our Artist of the Year this year has been nothing short of extraordinary. We congratulate him on his record-breaking year and for continuing to bring Latin music to a massive global audience.”
“When I started, I didn’t have a global fan base,” Bad Bunny tells Apple Music in an exclusive film, out today, that gets up close and personal with the 2022 Artist of the Year. “I’m grateful for everything I’ve accomplished and everything I’ve experienced. The Latin music movement has grown so much. I would never take full credit or say, ‘It’s because of me.’ No, it’s every one of us. A whole generation. Our energy and presence is always felt.” Upon being presented with the Apple Music Award, he adds: “Thank you to Apple Music and to all the people who listen to my music every day. I’m super happy!”

2022-11-10,Increase,Emergency SOS via satellite on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro lineups made possible by $450 million Apple investment in US infrastructure,"Text of this article
November 10, 2022
UPDATE
Emergency SOS via satellite on iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro lineups made possible by $450 million Apple investment in US infrastructure
Satellite network and ground stations power the new service launching later this month
A $450 million investment from Apple’s Advanced Manufacturing Fund provides the critical infrastructure that supports Emergency SOS via satellite for iPhone 14 models. Available to customers in the US and Canada beginning later this month, the new service will allow iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models to connect directly to a satellite, enabling messaging with emergency services when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.
A majority of the funding goes to Globalstar, a global satellite service headquartered in Covington, Louisiana, with facilities across the US. Apple’s investment provides critical enhancements to Globalstar’s satellite network and ground stations, ensuring iPhone 14 users are able to connect to emergency services when off the grid. At Globalstar, more than 300 employees support the new service.
“Emergency SOS via satellite is a perfect example of how American ingenuity and technology can save lives,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “We are proud this service is enabled by leading US companies, and that our users can explore off-the-grid areas knowing they are still within reach of emergency services if they are in need.”
Emergency SOS via satellite is just one of the groundbreaking safety capabilities the iPhone 14 lineup provides. Crash Detection can now detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services when a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.
Delivered in partnership with Globalstar, Apple’s Emergency SOS via satellite service utilizes the spectrum in L and S bands specially designated for mobile satellite services by ITU Radio Regulations. When an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by one of Globalstar’s 24 satellites in low-earth orbit traveling at speeds of approximately 16,000 mph. The satellite then sends the message down to custom ground stations located at key points all over the world.
Once received by a ground station, the message is routed to emergency services that can dispatch help, or a relay center with Apple-trained emergency specialists if local emergency services cannot receive text messages.
“The launch of Emergency SOS via satellite direct to iPhone is a generational advancement in satellite communications, and we are proud that Globalstar’s satellites and spectrum assets will play a central role in saving lives,” said Jay Monroe, Globalstar’s executive chairman. “With Apple’s infrastructure investment, we’ve grown our teams in California and elsewhere to construct, expand, and upgrade our ground stations, and we look forward to the next chapter in Globalstar’s lifesaving technology.”
The ground stations use new high-power antennas designed and manufactured specifically for Apple by Cobham Satcom in Concord, California. Cobham’s employees engineer and manufacture the high-powered antennas, which will receive signals transmitted by the satellite constellation. Along with communicating via text with emergency services, iPhone users can launch their Find My app and share their location via satellite when there is no cellular and Wi-Fi connection, providing a sense of security when off the typical communications grid.
To increase reliability and coverage, these new antennas were installed in all Globalstar worldwide ground stations, including new ground stations in Nevada and Hawaii, as well as existing facilities in Texas, Alaska, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Several antennas at each ground station communicate with the satellites and relay the information provided by the user so they can get the help they need.
To connect iPhone with the satellite network, users communicate over the mobile satellite services spectrum, which Globalstar has operated in the US for the past 20 years. With upgraded ground stations, and soon an updated satellite constellation, Apple and Globalstar will ensure the spectrum continues to enable emergency services.
In addition to the groundbreaking safety features, the iPhone 14 lineup features advanced camera systems, all-day battery life, and industry-leading durability features. Customers looking to upgrade to the iPhone 14 lineup can save up to $1,000 with trade-in — either online atapple.comor at an Apple Store — when they activate their device with select US carriers.
In 2021, Apple announced an acceleration in its US investments, with plans to make new contributions of more than $430 billion over a five-year period.

PRESS RELEASE
Emergency SOS via satellite available today on the iPhone 14 lineup in the US and Canada
iPhone 14 users can now connect with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available; the service extends to France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced its groundbreaking safety service Emergency SOS via satellite is now available to customers in the US and Canada. Available on all iPhone 14 models, the innovative technology enables users to message with emergency services while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid, they can now open the Find My app and share their location via satellite. Emergency SOS via satellite is available in the US and Canada starting today, November 15, and will come to France, Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December.
“Some of the most popular places to travel are off the beaten path and simply lack cellular coverage. With Emergency SOS via satellite, the iPhone 14 lineup provides an indispensable tool that can get users the help they need while they are off the grid,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Our teams worked tirelessly to tackle a new set of technical challenges to bring this service to life, in addition to building a reliable on-the-ground infrastructure. Emergency SOS via satellite is a breakthrough service available only on the iPhone 14 lineup, and a new innovation that we hope will provide our customers some peace of mind.”
Every model in the iPhone 14 lineup — iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max — can connect directly to a satellite through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software. Emergency SOS via satellite builds on existing features vital to iPhone users, including Emergency SOS, Medical ID, emergency contacts, and Find My location sharing, offering the ability to connect to a satellite for a more 360-degree approach to sharing critical information with emergency services, family, and friends. This game-changing service allows Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) — or emergency services call centers — to connect to even more users in emergency situations, and requires no additional software or protocols to enable communications. Users will be connected directly to emergency services that are equipped to receive text messages, or to relay centers with Apple-trained emergency specialists who are ready to contact PSAPs that cannot receive text messages on the user’s behalf.
“Providing Emergency SOS via satellite is an important breakthrough that will save lives. The critical work being done by Apple to create innovative new solutions to support 911 providers and first responders is a huge step forward in protecting Californians and the broader public during an emergency situation,” said Mark Ghilarducci, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services’ director.
How Emergency SOS via Satellite Works
iPhone can already quickly and easily call emergency services if a user is in need of help, even if they are unable to dial 911, with a long press on the power and volume buttons, or by rapidly pressing the power button five times. With Emergency SOS via satellite — introduced with the iPhone 14 lineup — if a user is not able to reach emergency services because no cellular or Wi-Fi coverage is available, an easy-to-use interface appears on iPhone to get the user help utilizing a satellite connection. A short questionnaire appears to help the user answer vital questions with a few simple taps, which is transmitted to dispatchers in the initial message, to ensure they are able to quickly understand a user’s situation and location. Apple worked closely with experts to review standard questions and protocols to identify the most common reasons for calling emergency services.
Following the questionnaire, the intuitive interface guides the user where to point their iPhone to connect and sends the initial message. This message includes the user’s questionnaire responses; location, including altitude; iPhone battery level; and Medical ID, if enabled. The questionnaire and follow-up messages are relayed directly via satellite to dispatchers that accept text messages, or to relay centers staffed by Apple‑trained specialists who can call for help on the user’s behalf. The transcript can also be shared with the user’s emergency contacts to keep them informed.1
“We dedicate our lives to helping people in need, but there are inevitably people who are not able to contact a dispatcher. Emergency SOS via satellite will allow us to help iPhone users in more remote areas who might not otherwise be able to reach us,” said Jennifer Kirkland, ENP, the Grand Junction Regional Communication Center’s 911 center manager. “Because this service requires no additional technology for PSAPs, and because Apple has implemented a relay center model that 911 operators are familiar with, we can expect a seamless rollout, both for the PSAPs that accept text messages, and for those that are still voice-only.”
Satellites move rapidly, have low bandwidth, and are located hundreds of miles away from Earth, so it can take a few minutes for even short messages to get through. Apple designed and built custom components and software that allow iPhone 14 to connect to a satellite’s unique frequencies without a bulky antenna. A text compression algorithm was also developed to reduce the average size of messages by 3x, making the experience as fast as possible. With Emergency SOS via satellite, users can send and receive messages in as little as 15 seconds in clear conditions.2Using the built-in Emergency SOS via satellite demo, users can test satellite connectivity on their iPhone by connecting to a real satellite in range without calling emergency services, allowing them to experience the process and familiarize themselves with the service.
“Emergency SOS via satellite will not only be useful for those who live in rural areas without cellular coverage, but also for those who find themselves in the path of a natural disaster that takes down mobile networks. It will allow members in impacted communities to connect with 911 and get help, and that’s our mission,” said Laurene Anderson, NENA: The 9-1-1 Association’s president and Charlotte County, Florida’s E911 manager. “Awareness and training will be key to seamless adoption of this service. What Apple is doing to spread the word among dispatchers, and to let the community practice with a demo mode that does not contact 911, will help everyone know what to do when an emergency strikes.”
For users who go off the grid but don’t experience an emergency, this advanced technology also enables them to share their location via satellite with Find My. In the Find My app, users can open the Me tab, swipe up to see My Location via Satellite, and tap Send My Location. The satellite connection on the iPhone 14 lineup also works with other safety features available on iPhone and Apple Watch, including Crash Detection and Fall Detection.3

UPDATE
The new Apple Pacific Centre opens in Vancouver
The completely reimagined store doubles in size, features sustainable design enhancements, and celebrates creativity with special Today at Apple sessions
Today the new Apple Pacific Centre opens on the vibrant intersection of West Georgia and Howe streets in the heart of Vancouver, Canada. The reimagined and enhanced Apple Pacific Centre doubles the size of the previous store, and adds additional features and elements. Customers are invited to discover, learn about, and buy Apple’s latest products and services; receive best-in-class support from knowledgeable Apple Specialists; and participate in free Today at Apple sessions that educate and inspire.
“We couldn’t be more excited to build on our longstanding history in Canada and welcome customers to the beautiful Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver, a community filled with creativity and deep culture,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “Facing the Vancouver Art Gallery and its bustling public plaza, the new Apple Pacific Centre was designed to be a hub for community, a place that brings people together with the expert care and support from our fantastic team.”
The expanded two-level store offers a communal space to unwind and enjoy the large plaza at the center of creative expression in the city.

Reach new depths with the Oceanic+ app and Apple Watch Ultra
Available today, the Oceanic+ app on Apple Watch Ultra turns Apple’s most rugged watch into a powerful and easy-to-use dive computer
Today, the Oceanic+ app comes to Apple Watch Ultra, turning Apple’s most rugged watch into a fully capable, easy-to-use dive computer. Designed by Huish Outdoors in collaboration with Apple, Oceanic+ enables recreational scuba divers to take the watch they wear every day to previously unreachable depths — up to 40 meters, or 130 feet, to be exact — with the all-new depth gauge and water temperature sensors on Apple Watch Ultra.
TheOceanic+ appon Apple Watch Ultra and the companion app for iPhone provide all of the key features of an advanced dive computer, robust dive planning, and a comprehensive post-dive experience.
“At Huish Outdoors, our purpose is fueling the human spirit for adventure,” says Mike Huish, the company’s CEO. “Oceanic+ on Apple Watch Ultra is one of the biggest innovations to hit the dive industry in a long time. We’re creating an accessible, shareable, better diving experience for everybody.”
When the first scuba divers took to the seas in the 1950s to explore the depths of the world’s waters, dive computers were still approximately 30 years away. By the ’80s and ’90s, many certified divers were still putting pen to paper to create their own dive tables. Using the Bühlmann decompression algorithm, they would track their depth and the time spent in the water to ensure they could safely plunge beneath the surface without overburdening their bodies with nitrogen.
Today, Apple Watch Ultra completely transforms this experience, giving recreational divers a more convenient, accessible device with all the features users already know and love on Apple Watch.1
“There’s now a companion that communicates clear and timely information to divers,” says Andrea Silvestri, Huish Outdoors’ vice president of product development and design, who led the creation of Oceanic+. Silvestri has been testing Oceanic+ on the watch underwater to get the app ready for launch.
He credits Apple Watch Ultra for its intuitiveness, allowing divers to stay in the moment focused on their environment without the burden of making mental calculations and complicated button clicks required by other dive computers. “From Apple Watch Ultra’s large, bright Retina display and dual-core S8 SiP, to its compact size, to the Digital Crown and dedicated Action button, and even the haptics, which are designed so well and are so noticeable in the water, there’s never been anything like this in scuba diving before now,” Silvestri says.
Built for endurance, exploration, and adventure, Apple Watch Ultra is certified to WR100 and EN 13319, an internationally recognized standard for dive accessories, including depth gauges.2The 49mm titanium case and flat sapphire front crystal reveals the biggest and brightest Apple Watch display yet, which — at up to 2000 nits — provides exceptional visibility underwater. The Action button can be customized to launch the Oceanic+ app into the predive screen, and during a dive, pressing the Action button will mark a compass bearing.
Silvestri recalls the early ’90s when he designed his first dive computer. “Most dive computers use a similar algorithm, but people basically need a degree to understand what the information is telling them,” he says. “One of the most revolutionary things about our new app is the user interface: the colors, the animations, with a single arrow telling me to ‘go up,’ ‘go down,’ ‘stop’ — that’s the easiest way to relay that information.”
“One of our first goals was to keep it intuitive,” says Mike Huish. “People who know how to use an Apple Watch already know how to use this dive computer, because it’s telling them things in a simple format they can understand. The navigation menus are simple — scrolling with the Digital Crown and using the Action button, you can navigate and use all the functionality of the dive computer while diving.”
In the dive planner, users can set their surface time, their depth, and their gas, and Oceanic+ will calculate their No Deco (no-decompression) time — a metric used to determine a time limit for a diver at a certain depth. The planner also integrates dive conditions, including tides, water temperature, and even up-to-date information from the community, such as visibility and currents. Post-dive, users will see data — including GPS entry and exit locations — automatically pop up on Apple Watch Ultra, along with a summary of their dive profile. The summary on the Oceanic+ iPhone app provides additional information, including a map of entry and exit locations, as well as graphs of depth, temperature ascent rate, and no-decompression limit.
One of the most intuitive features of Oceanic+ on Apple Watch Ultra is the haptic feedback, a design feat of both the hardware and software that enables the watch to tap users on the wrist through a series of vibrations, allowing divers to feel notifications underwater — even through a wetsuit that’s 7mm thick.
Though haptic feedback is a convenient, simple feature for everyday users, underwater, it plays an unexpected role: cutting through the noise of echoing sounds.
“Sound propagation in the water is much more powerful than in air,” Silvestri explains. “So if I’m diving with someone and their dive computer is emitting sound, I can’t really recognize if it’s my beep or it’s theirs. I’m hearing a beep, but I don’t know the direction. Incorporating the haptics designed for Ultra, we’ve made the experience very personal; it’s like a gentle nudge to guide you.”
The Oceanic+ app also offers complications that bring important information and tools to users at a glance, including no-fly time, surface time, quick access to the dive planner, dive settings, current elevation, maximum elevation allowed, and a quick access button back into the app. From planning the dive, to the first jump in, to their first step back on land, users can track and compare all of the details of their dives and share their experiences with fellow divers right from the app.
Ask any diver to describe what it feels like to dive, and they’ll share a variety of sensations. For Huish, it’s an element of flight and complete relaxation. Silvestri calls it a state of meditation: “It’s your time for yourself — it’s just you and your breath, surrounded by fish and a fantastic environment.”
Nick Hollis, the brand manager for Oceanic at Huish Outdoors who became a certified diver when he was 10 years old, talks about the thrill of venturing into the unknown. “The most exciting part is when you are making the initial descent to a reef or shipwreck — whatever you’re going down to see,” he says. “You may be lucky enough to see a giant manta ray, a school of hammerhead sharks, you could see dolphins. It’s really an unknown every time you make that jump in.”
Olivier Laguette, Huish Outdoors’ vice president of marketing, likens it to journeying into outer space — there’s a weightlessness and freedom that’s unachievable on land.
Oceanic+ was designed to assist anyone looking to dip a toe into the adventures that await in the underwater world. The app teams up with Apple Watch Ultra to handle all of the complex calculations required to explore the ocean safely, offering simple, easy-to-understand cues and guidance before, during, and after a dive.
It marks a new chapter in a century of exploration — and a half century of advancements in computing.
“One of the few sports where a computer is kind of a must-have is scuba diving,” says Silvestri. “Not everyone is a scuba diver every day, but diving is something we think people should be able to enjoy, spending time in the water and developing an even greater respect for nature. And that’s actually the main message, going back to Jacques Cousteau 50 years ago: We need to ride this wave; we need to have more people in the water.”

UPDATE
Apple expands its coding education resources with a new Today at Apple session
The free session comes to Apple Store locations worldwide during Computer Science Education Week, beginning December 5
In celebration of Computer Science Education Week, Apple is introducing a new coding session — Coding Lab for Kids: Code Your First App — at Apple Store locations around the world. Designed to inspire participants ages 10 and up to explore app development in a fun, welcoming environment, the new experience is the latest in Apple’s library of resources to help students, families, and educators launch their journeys in the growing field of computer science.
The new sessions begin December 5 as part of the Today at Apple program, which offers free, daily in-store sessions that assist customers in unleashing their creativity and making the most of their devices.1Anyone, including families and groups, can register now atapple.co/coding-sessions.
“Around the world, our stores are centers for community, where people of all ages are invited to discover the most innovative products, learn new skills, and explore their creative passions,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail + People. “Whether you’re trying something new like coding, or looking for tips for getting started with a device, our free Today at Apple sessions offer something for everyone — and our talented team members are always here to support you.”
Coding with Today at Apple
During the lab, Apple Creative Pros will lead aspiring coders and their guardians in an interactive activity using iPad andSwift Playgrounds— Apple’s fun and easy-to-use app that takes learners from their first line of code to their first app. Working in the About Me playground, participants will use SwiftUI and a new, real-time app preview to customize and bring their app to life with fun fonts, background colors, Memoji, and more.
After its launch, the new lab will become part of Apple’s rotating Today at Apple programming, with sessions scheduled at convenient times for kids and families. Customers can also sign up for Coding Skills: Getting Started with Swift Playgrounds, another Today at Apple session that introduces the Swift programming language and foundational concepts through an interactive game, allowing participants to explore coding basics like commands, functions, and loops.
Anyone — regardless of experience level — can visitapple.com/todayto sign up for scheduled Today at Apple sessions at their local Apple Store, or they can schedule a special lesson for their group, organization, or class at a time that works best for them. Today at Apple sessions are offered for free and use Apple-provided devices for all activities.
Resources for Learners and Educators
In-store Today at Apple coding sessions are one of many free resources Apple provides for learners of all ages.
For educators interested in introducing app development with Swift to their students, Apple created a companion guide for app building in Swift Playgrounds. Available in theApple Education Community, the Celebrating You Educator Guide features a starter project using the About Me playground, in which learners personalize a sample app that celebrates a place or tradition that’s important to them. The guide can be applied to any subject in the classroom or can be used by campus coding clubs.
Learners who are ready to explore additional topics in Swift and Xcode on iPad and Mac can turn to Apple’sEveryone Can Code and Develop in Swift resources. Teacher guides also help educators to build foundational knowledge in computer science to incorporate into their classrooms — from grade school tocollege and continued education.
Careers for the Next Generation
Apple’s coding resources are designed to teach essential skills while also preparing learners for high-demand careers in computer science. Earlier this year, independent analyses showed the iOS app economy continued its track record as an engine of economic growth and opportunity, supporting more than 2.2 million jobs in the US in 2021. This includes jobs for app entrepreneurs and their teams, with roles in software development, project management, design, and more.
Aspiring entrepreneurs, developers, and designers can also propel their skills and businesses through the Apple Developer Academy. First established in Brazil in 2013, the academy now operates in 17 locations around the world, including Detroit; Naples, Italy; and Pohang, South Korea. Thousands of participants have graduated — armed with technical fundamentals and core professional competencies — and gone on to pursue jobs in the thriving app economy, or even start their own businesses.

Apple announces the 2022 Apple Podcasts Award winner
Slate’s narrative nonfiction seriesSlow Burnhonored for latest season covering Roe v. Wade
Apple today announced the Apple Podcasts Award honoring a Show of the Year and its team for outstanding quality, innovation, and impact. Inspired by the signature app icon, the Apple Podcasts Award represents Apple’s decades-long commitment to supporting creators as they share their voices with the world and helping listeners to discover the best podcasts.
The recipient of the Apple Podcasts Award is Slate’s critically acclaimed narrative history series,Slow Burn, for its latest season, Roe v. Wade, hosted by Slate executive editor Susan Matthews. Published throughout June 2022, the four-episode season explores the events leading up to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision, offering listeners an in-depth perspective on this universal and timely human rights issue.
“Apple Podcasts is where users discover new shows, enjoy their favorites, unlock premium listening experiences, and support the creators who make them possible,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “Podcasting plays an important role in our lives — helping us stay informed, keep entertained, and get inspired — and we’re pleased to honor the Slate team with this recognition.”
“I wanted to make this series because I was really discouraged by how polarized and stuck the conversation around abortion was, and it seemed incredibly timely and important,” said host Susan Matthews. “We set out to tell this story in a way that helped expand and challenge what people understood about this subject. We decided the way to approach this season was to go back to the early ‘70s, when the abortion debate was still up in the air and your party affiliation didn’t correlate with your views on the issue. I am so honored that Apple Podcasts saw something special in this season. I hope people come to it with an open and curious mind, and appreciate listening to it as much as I did making it.”
Beginning today, users can also explore sixSlow Burn Extras— brand-new episodes available for free exclusively on Apple Podcasts that provide new perspectives and deeper insights. Listeners can hear about the making ofSlow Burn: Roe v. Wade, never-before-heard personal stories, extended follow-up interviews with characters from the series, and a roundtable conversation about the evolution of the Supreme Court featuring Slate’s legal experts.
Slow Burnis one of the all-time most popular shows on Apple Podcasts. The show’s first two seasons are hosted by Leon Neyfakh and cover the Watergate and Clinton-Lewinsky scandals, respectively. Additional seasons cover the creative lives and tragic deaths of two of the world’s most famous rappers, the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, as well as the LA riots (both hosted by Joel Anderson); David Duke’s rise to power and prominence (hosted by Josh Levin); and the road to the Iraq War (hosted by Noreen Malone). All seven seasons are available for free on Apple Podcasts.
Slow Burnhost Susan Matthews and Derek John, Slate’s executive producer of narrative podcasts,spoke with Apple Podcastsabout how they landed on Roe v. Wade for the latest season, what they learned in the course of reporting the series, how listeners have responded, and the podcasts that have moved and inspired them.

2022-12-01,Increase,Apple turns (RED) to raise visibility for World AIDS Day,"Text of this article
December 1, 2022
UPDATE
Apple turns (RED) to raise visibility for World AIDS Day
Apple customers have enabled care and support services for over 11 million people impacted by HIV/AIDS
Over the past 16 years, Apple and its customers have been part of the global fight to end AIDS. Apple’s partnership with (RED) supports the Global Fund, which provides access to healthcare services to millions of individuals in communities most in need in sub-Saharan Africa — including critical work in rural communities, and support for pregnant women and their families. In the last three years, funding has also been used to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in these communities.
Since 2006, more than a quarter of a billion dollars in Apple-supported grants have helped provide care and support services for over 11 million people and distribute over 197 million HIV tests. Apple’s support has also helped over 5 million HIV-positive mothers prevent passing the virus on to their babies.
Funding includes support for community health workers like Mama Esther, who deliver compassion, care, and access to treatment to their communities. For more than 15 years, she has gone frombomatoboma(house to house) in the Maasai community in Tanzania, providing in-home health services, encouraging people to visit the local clinic, and helping pregnant women access prenatal and delivery care. Mama Esther is able to do this important work in her rural community in part because of the monthly stipend she receives from the Global Fund.
During one of her community visits, Mama Esther met Neema, who was pregnant and very ill. Mama Esther encouraged her to get tested for HIV at the Mto wa Mbu Community Clinic, where Neema discovered she was positive for the virus. Fortunately, Neema immediately started an antiretroviral treatment — and not long after, she gave birth to an HIV-free baby.
Neema’s story is just one example of the care and support Apple’s customers have enabled.
In honor of World AIDS Day, Apple is offering new ways for customers to continue to support the Global Fund, raise awareness, and learn more about the battle to end HIV/AIDS.
Choose (RED) This Holiday Season
The best range of (PRODUCT)RED products are available this holiday season across iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone SE, and Apple Watch Series 8.
A variety of (PRODUCT)RED accessories are available, including the Silicone Case with MagSafe for iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, as well as the Apple Watch Sport Loop, Sport Band, and Braided Solo Loop bands. A portion of the proceeds from every (PRODUCT)RED purchase goes to the Global Fund to fight AIDS and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 with (RED).
Apple Watch users can show support with a selection of seven Apple Watch faces in red available for download fromapple.com/product-red.1Once downloaded, users can raise awareness by sharing these faces with other Apple Watch users.
Raising Visibility
To raise visibility for World AIDS Day, Apple is using its platform and services to highlight the ongoing effort to end HIV/AIDS and create opportunities for its customers to learn more.
Around the world, hundreds of Apple Store locations are marking the day with new window and product displays, making it easy for customers to learn about (PRODUCT)RED and support the Global Fund with their holiday purchases.
On the App Store, customers can learn more aboutPreppy+, an app that helps people affected by HIV by making it easier to track PrEP (or pre-exposure prophylaxis) and maintain full and happy relationships. By taking PrEP on a daily or occasional basis, users can effectively prevent an infection, and the app can assist them in keeping track of PrEP intake, entering PrEP checkups, adding information to a calendar, and storing test results.
In the US, Apple Books features curated collections of books and audiobooks, including nonfiction about the global fight against HIV/AIDS and fiction from around the world. Apple TV app users can explore a compelling collection of shows and movies on the Watch Now tab that shine a light on the human cost of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. And Apple Music features a special selection of music programming, radio episodes, and more for subscribers to recognize the day.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple announces biggest upgrade to App Store pricing, adding 700 new price points
Developers will also gain new flexibility to manage pricing globally
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the most comprehensive upgrade to pricing capabilities since the App Store first launched, providing developers with 700 additional price points and new pricing tools that will make it easier to set prices per App Store country or region, manage foreign exchange rate changes, and more.
Since the App Store’s inception, its world-class commerce and payments system has empowered developers to conveniently set up and sell their products and services on a global scale.The App Store’s commerce and payments system offers developers an ever-expanding set of capabilities and tools to grow their businesses, from frictionless checkout and transparent invoicing for users to robust marketing tools, tax and fraud services, and refund management.
Pricing has been foundational to these capabilities, enabling developers to choose from a variety of business models, such as one-time purchases and multiple subscription types. These new pricing enhancements will be available for apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions starting today, and for all other apps and in-app purchases in spring 2023, giving all developers unprecedented flexibility and control to price their products in 45 currencies throughout 175 storefronts.
Under the updated App Store pricing system, all developers will have the ability to select from 900 price points, which is nearly 10 times the number of price points previously available for most apps. This includes 600 new price points to choose from, with an additional 100 higher price points available upon request. To provide developers around the world with even more flexibility, price points — which will start as low as $0.29 and, upon request, go up to $10,000 — will offer an enhanced selection of price points, increasing incrementally across price ranges (for example, every $0.10 up to $10; every $0.50 between $10 and $50; etc.). See the table below for details.
In each of the App Store’s 175 storefronts, developers will be able to leverage additional pricing conventions, including those that begin with two repeating digits (e.g., ₩110,000), and will be able to price products beyond $0.99 or €X.99 endings to incorporate rounded price endings (e.g., X.00 or X.90), which are particularly useful for managing bundles and annual plans.
Starting today, developers of subscription apps will also be able to manage currency and taxes across storefronts more effortlessly by choosing a local storefront they know best as the basis for automatically generating prices across the other 174 storefronts and 44 currencies. Developers will still be able to define prices per storefront if they wish. The pricing capability by storefront will expand to all other apps in spring 2023.
For developers distributing their apps around the world, the App Store’s global equalization tools have given them a simple and convenient way to manage pricing across international markets. Today’s enhancements expand upon these capabilities, allowing developers to keep their local currency constant in any storefront of their choice, even as foreign exchange and taxes fluctuate. This means, for example, a Japanese game developer who gets most of their business from Japanese customers can set their price for the Japan storefront, and have their prices outside of the country update as foreign exchange and tax rates change. All developers will also be able to define availability of in-app purchases by storefront.
Periodically, Apple updates prices in certain regions based on changes in taxes and foreign exchange rates. This is done using publicly available exchange rate information from financial data providers to help ensure prices for in-app purchases stay equalized across all storefronts. Currently, developers can adjust pricing at any time to react to tax and foreign currency adjustments. Coming in 2023, developers with paid apps and in-app purchases will be able to set local territory pricing, which will not be impacted by automatic price adjustments.
These newly announced tools, which will begin rolling out today and continue throughout 2023, will create even more flexibility for developers to price their products while staying approachable to the hundreds of millions of users Apple serves worldwide, and in turn help developers continue to thrive on the App Store.

2022-12-06,Decrease,Apple launches Self Service Repair in Europe,"Text of this article
December 6, 2022
UPDATE
Apple launches Self Service Repair in Europe
Customers in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK can purchase genuine Apple parts and tools
Apple today announced Self Service Repair is now available in eight European countries, providing repair manuals and genuine Apple parts and tools through the AppleSelf Service Repair Store. Customers who wish to complete their own repairs will be able to perform many of the most common repairs for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and Mac notebooks with Apple silicon.
The Self Service Repair Store provides access to more than 200 individual parts and tools, as well as repair manuals. The program enables customers who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices the opportunity to complete their own repairs, using the same manuals, parts, and tools as Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers.
“We believe the best technology for our customers and for the planet is technology that lasts, which is why we design our products to be durable and rarely require maintenance or repair,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “But when a repair is needed, we want customers to have many options for safe, reliable, and secure repair. That’s why we’re excited to launch Self Service Repair in Europe, giving our customers direct access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and manuals.”
Every genuine Apple part is designed and engineered for each product, and goes through extensive testing to ensure the highest quality, safety, and reliability. The parts are the same ones — at the same price — as those available to Apple’s network of authorized repair providers. Customers can send replaced parts back to Apple for refurbishment and recycling, and in many cases receive credit off their purchase by doing so.
The Apple tools available to customers on the Self Service Repair Store are custom designed to help provide the best repairs for Apple products, and are engineered to withstand the rigors of high-volume, professional repair operations where safety and reliability are the utmost priority. The high-quality tools offered through Self Service Repair include torque drivers, repair trays, display and battery presses, and more.
Apple will offer tool rental kits for $49, so that customers who do not want to purchase tools for a single repair still have access to these professional repair tools. The weeklong rental kits will ship to customers for free.
Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to further expand access to repairs and increase repairability of products over time. For the vast majority of customers who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.
Over the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 4,000 Independent Repair Providers. A global network of more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers supports more than 100,000 active technicians. As a result, eight out of 10 Apple customers are located within 30 minutes of an authorized service provider across Europe.

2022-12-07,Decrease,Apple advances user security with powerful new data protections,"Text of this article
December 7, 2022
UPDATE
Apple advances user security with powerful new data protections
iMessage Contact Key Verification, Security Keys for Apple ID, and Advanced Data Protection for iCloud provide users with important new tools to protect their most sensitive data and communications
Apple today introduced three advanced security features focused on protecting against threats to user data in the cloud, representing the next step in its ongoing effort to provide users with even stronger ways to protect their data. With iMessage Contact Key Verification, users can verify they are communicating only with whom they intend. With Security Keys for Apple ID, users have the choice to require a physical security key to sign in to their Apple ID account. And with Advanced Data Protection for iCloud, which uses end-to-end encryption to provide Apple’s highest level of cloud data security, users have the choice to further protect important iCloud data, including iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, and more.
As threats to user data become increasingly sophisticated and complex, these new features join a suite of other protections that make Apple products the most secure on the market: from the security built directly into our custom chips with best-in-class device encryption and data protections, to features like Lockdown Mode, which offers an extreme, optional level of security for users such as journalists, human rights activists, and diplomats. Apple is committed to strengthening both device and cloud security, and to adding new protections over time.
“At Apple, we are unwavering in our commitment to provide our users with the best data security in the world. We constantly identify and mitigate emerging threats to their personal data on device and in the cloud,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Our security teams work tirelessly to keep users’ data safe, and with iMessage Contact Key Verification, Security Keys, and Advanced Data Protection for iCloud, users will have three powerful new tools to further protect their most sensitive data and communications.”
iMessage Contact Key Verification
Apple pioneered the use of end-to-end encryption in consumer communication services with the launch of iMessage, so that messages could only be read by the sender and recipients. FaceTime has also used encryption since launch to keep conversations private and secure. Now with iMessage Contact Key Verification, users who face extraordinary digital threats — such as journalists, human rights activists, and members of government — can choose to further verify that they are messaging only with the people they intend. The vast majority of users will never be targeted by highly sophisticated cyberattacks, but the feature provides an important additional layer of security for those who might be. Conversations between users who have enabled iMessage Contact Key Verification receive automatic alerts if an exceptionally advanced adversary, such as a state-sponsored attacker, were ever to succeed breaching cloud servers and inserting their own device to eavesdrop on these encrypted communications. And for even higher security, iMessage Contact Key Verification users can compare a Contact Verification Code in person, on FaceTime, or through another secure call.
Security Keys
Apple introduced two-factor authentication for Apple ID in 2015. Today, with more than 95 percent of active iCloud accounts using this protection, it is the most widely used two-factor account security system in the world that we’re aware of. Now with Security Keys, users will have the choice to make use of third-party hardware security keys to enhance this protection. This feature is designed for users who, often due to their public profile, face concerted threats to their online accounts, such as celebrities, journalists, and members of government. For users who opt in, Security Keys strengthens Apple’s two-factor authentication by requiring a hardware security key as one of the two factors. This takes our two-factor authentication even further, preventing even an advanced attacker from obtaining a user’s second factor in a phishing scam.
Advanced Data Protection for iCloud
For years, Apple has offered industry-leading data security on its devices with Data Protection, the sophisticated file encryption system built into iPhone, iPad, and Mac. “Apple makes the most secure mobile devices on the market. And now, we are building on that powerful foundation,” said Ivan Krstić, Apple’s head of Security Engineering and Architecture. “Advanced Data Protection is Apple’s highest level of cloud data security, giving users the choice to protect the vast majority of their most sensitive iCloud data with end-to-end encryption so that it can only be decrypted on their trusted devices.” For users who opt in, Advanced Data Protection keeps most iCloud data protected even in the case of a data breach in the cloud.
iCloud already protects 14 sensitive data categories using end-to-end encryption by default, including passwords in iCloud Keychain and Health data. For users who enable Advanced Data Protection, the total number of data categories protected using end-to-end encryption rises to 23, including iCloud Backup, Notes, and Photos. The only major iCloud data categories that are not covered are iCloud Mail, Contacts, and Calendar because of the need to interoperate with the global email, contacts, and calendar systems.
Enhanced security for users’ data in the cloud is more urgently needed than ever before, as demonstrated in a new summary of data breach research, “The Rising Threat to Consumer Data in the Cloud,” published today. Experts say the total number of data breaches more than tripled between 2013 and 2021, exposing 1.1 billion personal records across the globe in 2021 alone. Increasingly, companies across the technology industry are addressing this growing threat by implementing end-to-end encryption in their offerings.

FEATURE
Across the globe, Apple and its teams find new ways to give
The company’s Employee Giving program has raised over $880 million, with more than 2 million volunteer hours logged
Since January, Apple Store team member Maranda Barhorst has volunteered her time remotely reading audiobooks for children at Ronald McDonald House in Washington, D.C.; helping a doula in Tennessee create materials for her nonprofit that aims to reduce maternal mortality rates; and designing cards that highlight Black professionals to inspire students in Chicago. That’s in addition to volunteering in person with Big Brothers Big Sisters in her hometown of Cincinnati. And the year’s not over yet.
“I never needed for anything growing up, but it wasn’t easy either,” says Barhorst, a manager at Cincinnati’s Apple Kenwood Towne Centre who is part of Apple’s Global Volunteer Program. “So any opportunity to make it a little bit easier for someone else is something that speaks to my soul — if I can, then I should. Because helping someone be courageous or feel included can change the future, and it’s important to be one of those ripples in the pond.”
Since its inception 11 years ago, Apple’s Employee Giving program has raised over $880 million dollars for almost 44,000 organizations globally. That includes the work of more than 76,000 employees who have logged more than 2.1 million volunteer hours. For every hour an Apple employee volunteers or dollar they donate, Apple matches with a monetary donation to the same organization. In addition to volunteer activities and contributions made through the Employee Giving program, Apple also contributes millions of dollars to nonprofits through corporate grants.
This year, in communities around the world, Apple and its team members contributed to local organizations and global causes in extraordinary ways. From weekly volunteer engagements to local grants in support of food banks, and from professional mentoring to environmental cleanup events, the Apple community showed up for the people and places it calls home.
Earlier this year, for example, Apple launched a two-to-one matching program for all employee donations to organizations helping support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. The company also contributed directly to groups on the ground, including World Central Kitchen (WCK), a nonprofit founded by chef José Andrés that provides meals for people in crisis. Since February 25, the day after the invasion, WCK has served more than 177 million meals across eight countries in the region.
Across Europe, Apple employees are incredibly active in their communities, including in Cork, Ireland. Among other engagements, teams there have volunteered for the last five years at the Field of Dreams, a three-acre horticultural site operated by Down Syndrome Ireland. In 2022, volunteer engagement is up more than 250 percent year over year, with 850 volunteers completing more than 2,000 hours with the organization. That has a lot to do with the efforts of Apple’s Brian O’Leary, who helps to coordinate Apple events at the Field of Dreams.
“During the pandemic, the site became a little unkempt — the weeds don’t stop growing,” says Debbie Kelleher, the Field of Dreams care coordinator. “But Brian came out after the restrictions were lifted and said that the Apple teams were very keen to help out more regularly. We now have Apple volunteers here almost every Friday — we call them Apple Fridays.”
“When people volunteer at the Field of Dreams, they walk away feeling they’ve made an impact, and that’s what makes us all come back,” says O’Leary, who is already planning next year’s visits. “This organization is making a real difference in the lives of the people it’s serving, and to play even a small role in that means a great deal.”
In sub-Saharan Africa, Apple continues its 16-year partnership with the Global Fund through the (PRODUCT)RED campaign, which has raised more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help in the fight to end AIDS. Those efforts support dozens of organizations across the region, including the Zanzibar Association for People with HIV/AIDS (ZAPHA+), which has cared for thousands of children living with HIV through counseling and support groups.
That includes Miriam, who joined ZAPHA+ after she found out she was HIV positive as a teenager. The organization inspired her to become a community health worker, and she is now married with a child who is HIV negative thanks to antiretroviral treatment.
Among its community engagements in Australia, this year Apple expanded its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to the country. The initiative supports a variety of organizations advancing equity in the country’s Indigenous community, including ID. Know Yourself. Founded by Isaiah Dawe in 2019, the nonprofit helps support and mentor young members of the Aboriginal community who are in foster or out-of-home care.
“I always say our purpose is founded by wounds, because I have grown up exactly like the kids we work with — and there are more than 20,000 Aboriginal kids in out-of-home care in Australia,” says Dawe, a Butchulla and Gawara Salt Water man who was in the Australian foster care system from infancy to when he turned 18. “At ID. Know Yourself, we create love, hope, and belonging so that every child can have self-determination and fulfillment in their life. We’ve been working with Apple for a few years now, and it’s amazing to see our kids express themselves in creative sessions that draw on their Aboriginal heritage and culture — they feel empowered because they’re connecting with their past and learning skills they need for their future.”
Across the globe, Today at Apple expanded its Creative Studios program, which partners with community organizations, mentors, and Apple Store teams to offer career-building creative experiences. In Tokyo, members of Sankakusha — a nonprofit that helps young adults struggling with isolation — were connected with professionals in the fields of photography and videography for a five-week course that culminated with each participant presenting their creative work.
“It was incredible to see the transformation that happened through the power of creativity — it’s not something we could have done by ourselves in such a short time,” says Sankakusha’s founder, Yusuke Arai. “The commitment of the mentors and the skills they taught enabled our youth to express themselves and find their voice. Some of our members became more confident than we could have imagined; after the program finished, a few found full-time jobs and another went back to school.”
In Shanghai, Apple Store team member Elyn Tang has volunteered throughout the year with organizations that clean up local rivers and help families who have children with disabilities. She also participated in an event with Rainbow Volunteer Club, a group that helps connect teenage girls living in rural areas of the country with mentors. In March, Tang worked with the organization and wrote a letter of support to a young girl, not knowing who would receive it, and not expecting a reply. But in June, she received an email that touched her heart.
“The girl who wrote back told me that my letter made her feel like she wasn’t alone,” says Tang, who is raising a young daughter of her own. “She said she had always wanted to become a teacher, yet had been at a loss and didn’t know how to make it happen. My letter inspired her to work hard to make that dream come true. I feel like my words helped to empower her, and that brings me a sense of peace.”
Around the world, Apple supports the work of food banks and other organizations that address food disparity through its Strengthen Local Communities grant program and other programming. And employees regularly team up with local organizations to help provide food, shelter, and other services to those in need.
In India, the organization Rise Against Hunger hosted multiple meal-packaging events at Apple campuses in Bengaluru and Hyderabad that collectively put together over 30,000 meals.
“It’s important for me to participate in social welfare activities because I feel that everyone should give back to their community if they can,” says Apple team member Vinod Nitturi, who volunteered at the Hyderabad event. “I have been blessed, and so if I can help someone who is struggling, I will do whatever is in my power to make that possible.”
As part of its work to advance environmental justice and advocate for communities most impacted by climate change and environmental disparities, Apple this year provided grants to environmental justice organizations, including the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition, the Center for Diversity and the Environment, the Native Conservancy, and UPROSE. And for Earth Day, more than 1,300 Apple team members participated in dozens of cleanups and environmentally focused events across the globe.
Like many of her colleagues around the world, Apple Store team member Sandra Maranhão is incredibly passionate about contributing her time to environmental causes. But she also volunteers with organizations that raise awareness around prostate cancer, help those living on the streets, and support young people in her community in Rio de Janeiro.
“Volunteering is very fulfilling — that feeling of paying back to others what has been given to me is priceless,” says Maranhão, an Expert at Apple VillageMall. “It’s one of the best things about working at Apple; it gives me time so that I can contribute to my community. There’s a phrase that’s part of our credo about making the world a better place, and this is something that guides me. I want the Earth to be as beautiful as it is today for when my children grow up, and we can all do our part to make that possible.”

2022-12-13,Decrease,Apple launches Freeform: a powerful new app designed for creative brainstorming and collaboration,"Text of this article
December 13, 2022
UPDATE
Apple launches Freeform: a powerful new app designed for creative brainstorming and collaboration
Freeform for iPhone, iPad, and Mac makes visual collaboration easier than ever
Freeform is an all-new app available starting today, included in the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Freeform helps users organize and visually lay out content on a flexible canvas, giving them the ability to see, share, and collaborate all in one place without worrying about layouts or page sizes. Users can add a wide range of files and preview them inline without ever leaving the board. Designed for collaboration, Freeform makes it easier than ever to invite others to work on a board together. Users can even collaborate with others while on a FaceTime call. Freeform boards are stored in iCloud, so users can stay in sync across devices.
“Freeform opens up endless possibilities for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users to visually collaborate,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “With an infinite canvas, support for uploading a wide range of files, iCloud integration, and collaboration capabilities, Freeform creates a shared space for brainstorming that users can take anywhere.”
A Canvas Built for Creativity with Easy-to-Use Tools
Freeform is the perfect whiteboard experience for gathering inspiration and ideas all in one place. The infinite canvas expands as content is added to the board for unlimited flexibility when working with many files or collaborating with others. Users can seamlessly move around the board with support for built-in gestures.
The app offers a variety of brush styles and color options to sketch ideas, add comments, and draw diagrams. iPhone and iPad users can draw anywhere on the canvas with their finger, and with support for Apple Pencil, Freeform makes it easier than ever to sketch ideas on iPad while on the go.
Freeform supports a wide range of files, including photos, video, audio, documents, PDFs, links to websites and map location links, sticky notes, shapes, diagrams, and more. iPhone and iPad cameras can even be used to insert an image or scanned doc directly into the board. With a full shapes library, Freeform gives users over 700 options to choose from, allowing users to change the color and size, add text, and even create personalized shapes.
Users can drag and drop content onto the board from other apps including Files and Finder, and with built-in alignment guides, it is easy to keep the board organized. With Quick Look, users can preview content with a double tap without ever leaving the board, and multiple video files can play at the same time to create a dynamic view. Content like images and PDFs can be locked into place on a board, and collaborators can then annotate on top of or around the object — making Freeform the perfect tool for sketching ideas on top of floor plans for a home renovation project, or for coaches to map out plays on an image of a basketball court.
A Collaboration Space
Whether a user is working at a desk or on the go, Freeform is incredibly useful for standalone projects or when collaborating with others. With the ability to work with up to 100 collaborators in the same board, Freeform creates a shared space for creativity when working on group projects or even planning a vacation with friends.
Freeform takes advantage of the new collaboration features in Messages, which lets users invite others to a Freeform board by simply dragging it into a Messages thread. All members of that thread will be automatically invited to the boards and can begin collaborating immediately. When someone makes an edit, activity updates will show up at the top of the Messages thread.
With FaceTime built right into the app, users can start a FaceTime call within Freeform by tapping the collaboration button at the top right of the screen. All collaborators can view others’ contributions as they add content or make edits with fast-sync capabilities and iCloud integration. Freeform boards are synced across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and users can invite others via a link or email, and even export a board as a PDF or take a screenshot.
Availability
Starting today, Freeform comes free on every iPhone, iPad, and Mac supporting iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, or macOS Ventura 13.1.

UPDATE
Apple Fitness+ unveils new offerings for the new year
Beginning January 9, the service will introduce a new Kickboxing workout type, a brand-new sleep theme for meditations, a Beyoncé Artist Spotlight, new Time to Walk guests, and three new trainers
Apple Fitness+, the award-winning fitness and wellness service that is welcoming to all, is introducing new ways for users to improve their overall well-being in the new year. Starting Monday, January 9, the service will launch Kickboxing, a new total-body cardio workout type. A brand-new meditation theme, Sleep, will join the nine other themes in the Meditation library, all designed to make users’ practice more impactful than ever before. To help them get started, a new program called Introduction to Meditations for Sleep — designed to help users wind down before bed and drift off to sleep — will launch.
Additionally, Artist Spotlight will launch new workouts featuring music by Beyoncé, including songs from her latest album,RENAISSANCE, bringing her iconic music to the service. Time to Walk will kick off its fifth season with new guests, including Golden Globe-nominated actor Jamie Lee Curtis, late-night talk show host Amber Ruffin, Olympic champion figure skater Nathan Chen, and German actor Nina Hoss. Fitness+ will also launch two new Collections — 6 Weeks to Restart Your Fitness and Level Up Your Core Training — as well as welcome three new trainers to the team.
“No matter where people are on their health and well-being journey, Fitness+ makes it easy to get started and stay motivated with workouts and meditations that are welcoming to all,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of Fitness Technologies. “Whether people want to boost their cardio with the newest workout type, Kickboxing; move to Beyoncé’s latest hits; or wind down before bed with a meditation, there really is something for everyone to take care of their body and mind in the new year.”
Kickboxing and New Trainers
Kickboxing workouts can help build full-body fitness, and are a great way to build strength, stamina, coordination, and balance. Starting January 9, Fitness+ will add Kickboxing as a new total-body cardio workout type. Each workout will consist of a distinct round of moves followed by one final round, which will combine the moves users just learned into an all-out one-minute interval. No equipment is required, and workouts will be 10, 20, or 30 minutes long.
Kickboxing will be led by two Fitness+ trainers. Jamie-Ray Hartshorne, who users know and love from Treadmill, HIIT, and Time to Run workouts, trained in muay thai and professionally competed in Thailand.
Additionally, Nez Dally will join the trainer team to lead Kickboxing workouts. The muay thai fighter made history when she became the first woman to compete in Thailand wearing a hijab. In her workouts, she brings the drive of a high-achieving athlete to empower users with every jab, cross, and kick.
In addition to Dally, two more new trainers will join the Fitness+ trainer team in January: Brian Cochrane for HIIT and Jenn Lau for Strength. Cochrane, who hails from Scotland, grew up playing a variety of sports, making his HIIT training a versatile practice. As a former singer in an indie band, he continues to be inspired by the way music and movement come together.
Lau co-founded a gym in her hometown of Toronto, and she is just as passionate about inclusivity as she is about helping people stay active. She brings tenacity and playfulness to every lift and lunge she teaches.
Introducing Sleep Meditation
Meditation on Fitness+ is designed to help users release tension and anxiety. A brand-new Meditation theme, Sleep, will be added to the Meditation library, joining the nine other themes, including Calm, Gratitude, Resilience, and Creativity. The robust library is designed to make the practice of meditation more powerful and useful than ever before. New sleep meditations will be added every week, and each practice can be done as part of a wind-down routine or while drifting off.
To help users get started with sleep meditations, a new program, Introduction to Meditations for Sleep, will launch. The program consists of four 20-minute meditations that conclude with five minutes of relaxing music. The meditations — which can be done in any order at any time, each using different techniques to help users slow down and rest — include “Quiet Your Mind,” “Relax Your Body,” “Appreciate Your Day,” and “Visualize Rest.”
Artist Spotlight with Beyoncé
The Artist Spotlight series — which dedicates an entire workout playlist to a single artist — expands with new workouts featuring music by Beyoncé, including songs from her latest album,RENAISSANCE,bringing her iconic music to the service. On Monday, January 9, seven new workouts featuring the singer’s music will be available across Cycling, Dance, HIIT, Pilates, Strength, Treadmill, and Yoga. The energy and themes in each workout are inspired by the album’s notion of rediscovering what makes individuals unique and powerful to help uplift users in the new year.
Fitness+ will also roll out two additional Artist Spotlight offerings: the Foo Fighters on Monday, January 16, and Bad Bunny on Monday, January 23.
Time to Walk
Fitness+ will introduce new episodes of Time to Walk, beginning with acclaimed actor Jamie Lee Curtis. Time to Walk — an inspiring audio experience on iPhone and Apple Watch, designed to help people walk more often — features some of the world’s most interesting and influential people, who share stories, photos, and music with Fitness+ users. Curtis — a producer, bestselling author, activist, and philanthropist — was most recently nominated for a Golden Globe for her role in the filmEverything Everywhere All at Once. On this walk, Curtis reflects on the importance of embracing life’s most unexpected moments, the transformative power of serving others in need, and how the death of a beloved public figure led her to a daily ritual of self-reflection.
As the series kicks off its fifth season, new guests will be added each week, including:

UPDATE
Apple celebrates a groundbreaking year in entertainment
Apple’s Eddy Cue reflects on the year in services
2022 was a groundbreaking year for entertainment. At some point over the past year, you probably discovered a new app, a new song, a new TV show or movie, or game. An experience that made you laugh, taught you something new, or helped you see the world in a new way — and moved you to share it with others.
It’s remarkable how much great content is at our fingertips; that’s a testament to the extraordinary work of creators worldwide. Never before have we enjoyed instant access to more cinematic original series, more engaging films, more global music, more creative apps, more essential journalism, and more immersive games and sports — no matter where you are, across all your favorite devices.
At Apple, we have the privilege of partnering with creators of all kinds, while building products and services that enable even more creativity. Our mission has always been to enrich people’s lives and to leave the world better than we found it, and we know that takes more than technical skill. It requires leading with our values in everything we do.
We believe that our products and services should be made for everyone. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right, and that our highest obligation to our customers is security. We believe that a culture where everybody belongs can drive innovation, and that we must stand up for the change we want to see in the world.
When we started Apple TV+ a few years ago, we did so to tell stories that reflect our broader humanity. And whether it wasCODAwinning the Oscar for Best Picture orTed Lassowinning back-to-back Emmys for Best Comedy, we have seen, in so many ways, the validation of this kind of storytelling and the strong desire for more of it.
And believe me: There’s much more to come. Moments to anticipate, enjoy, and reflect upon. Moments that will have us jumping up with excitement or at the edge of our seats, or that make us want to get up and dance. Moments that can create lasting memories and bring us closer to one another.
Last week marked my 34th anniversary at Apple, and I’ve never been more excited about what’s ahead. This new year of Apple services will be our most exciting yet — and we can’t wait to share it with you.
— Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services

Powering a robust global economy, the App Store connects developers of all sizes, from emerging solo creators to large international teams, with more than 650 million visitors across 175 regions each week.

Packed with Apple innovations and Siri intelligence, HomePod offers advanced computational audio for a groundbreaking listening experience, including support for immersive Spatial Audio tracks. With convenient new ways to manage everyday tasks and control the smart home, users can now create smart home automations using Siri, get notified when a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm is detected in their home, and check temperature and humidity in a room — all hands-free.
The new HomePod is available to order online and in the Apple Store app starting today, with availability beginning Friday, February 3.
“Leveraging our audio expertise and innovations, the new HomePod delivers rich, deep bass, natural mid-range, and clear, detailed highs,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “With the popularity of HomePod mini, we’ve seen growing interest in even more powerful acoustics achievable in a larger HomePod. We’re thrilled to bring the next generation of HomePod to customers around the world.”
Refined Design
With a seamless, acoustically transparent mesh fabric and a backlit touch surface that illuminates from edge to edge, the new HomePod boasts a beautiful design that complements any space. HomePod is available in white and midnight, a new color made with 100 percent recycled mesh fabric, with a color-matched woven power cable.
Acoustic Powerhouse
HomePod delivers incredible audio quality, with rich, deep bass and stunning high frequencies. A custom-engineered high-excursion woofer, powerful motor that drives the diaphragm a remarkable 20mm, built-in bass-EQ mic, and beamforming array of five tweeters around the base all work together to achieve a powerful acoustic experience. The S7 chip is combined with software and system-sensing technology to offer even more advanced computational audio that maximizes the full potential of its acoustic system for a groundbreaking listening experience.
With room sensing technology, HomePod recognizes sound reflections from nearby surfaces to determine if it is against a wall or freestanding, and then adapts sound in real time. Precise directional control of its beamforming array of five tweeters separates and beams direct and ambient audio, immersing listeners in crystal-clear vocals and rich instrumentation.
Users can listen to a catalog of over 100 million songs with Apple Music,1enjoy Spatial Audio with a single HomePod or as a stereo pair, or create a captivating home theater experience with Apple TV 4K. With Siri, users can access a range of music knowledge, and search by artist, song, lyrics, decade, genre, mood, or activity.
Elevated Experience with Multiple HomePod Speakers
Two or more HomePod or HomePod mini speakers unlock a variety of powerful features. Using multiroom audio with AirPlay,2users can simply say “Hey Siri,” or touch and hold the top of HomePod to play the same song on multiple HomePod speakers, play different songs on different HomePod speakers, or even use them as an intercom to broadcast messages to other rooms.
Users can also create a stereo pair with two HomePod speakers in the same space.3In addition to separating the left and right channels, a stereo pair plays each channel in perfect harmony, creating a wider, more immersive soundstage than traditional stereo speakers for a truly standout listening experience.
Seamless Integration with the Apple Ecosystem
Leveraging Ultra Wideband technology, users can hand off whatever they’re playing on iPhone — like a favorite song, podcast, or even a phone call — directly to a HomePod.4To easily control what’s playing or receive personalized song and podcast recommendations, anyone in the home can bring an iPhone close to HomePod and suggestions will surface automatically. HomePod can also recognize up to six voices, so each member of the home can hear their personal playlists, ask for reminders, and set calendar events.
HomePod easily pairs with Apple TV 4K for a powerful home theater experience, and eARC (Enhanced Audio Return Channel)5support on Apple TV 4K enables customers to make HomePod the audio system for all devices connected to the TV. Plus, with Siri on HomePod, users can control what’s playing on their Apple TV hands-free.
Find My on HomePod makes it possible for users to locate their Apple devices, like an iPhone, by playing a sound on the misplaced device. Using Siri, users can also ask for the location of friends or loved ones who share their location via the app.
A Smart Home Essential
With Sound Recognition,6HomePod can listen for smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, and send a notification directly to the user’s iPhone if a sound is identified. The new built-in temperature and humidity sensor can measure indoor environments, so users can create automations that close the blinds or turn on the fan automatically when a certain temperature is reached in a room.
By activating Siri, customers can control a single device or create scenes like “Good Morning” that put multiple smart home accessories to work at the same time, or set up recurring automations hands-free like “Hey Siri, open the blinds every day at sunrise.”7A new confirmation tone indicates when a Siri request is made to control an accessory that may not visibly show a change, like a heater, or for accessories located in a different room. Ambient sounds — like ocean, forest, and rain — have also been remastered and are more integrated into the experience, enabling customers to add new sounds to scenes, automations, and alarms.
Users can also intuitively navigate, view, and organize accessories with the redesigned Home app, which offers new categories for climate, lights, and security, enables easy setup and control of the smart home, and includes a new multicamera view.
Matter Support
Matter launched last fall, enabling smart home products to work across ecosystems while maintaining the highest levels of security. Apple is a member of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, which maintains the Matter standard, along with other industry leaders. HomePod connects to and controls Matter-enabled accessories, and serves as an essential home hub, giving users access when away from home.
Customer Data Is Private Property
Protecting customer privacy is one of Apple’s core values. All smart home communications are always end-to-end encrypted so they can’t be read by Apple, including camera recordings with HomeKit Secure Video. When Siri is used, the audio of the request is not stored by default. These features give users peace of mind that their privacy is protected at home.
HomePod and the Environment
HomePod is designed to minimize its environmental impact, and includes 100 percent recycled gold — a first for HomePod — in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in the speaker magnet. HomePod meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is mercury-, BFR-, PVC-, and beryllium-free. Redesigned packaging eliminates the outer plastic wrap, and 96 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.

UPDATE
In celebration of Black History Month, Apple releases new Black Unity collection and content
Apple commemorates Black History Month with exclusive content and curated launches celebrating Black culture and community. Starting today, customers can show their support with this year’s Black Unity Collection, which includes a special-edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, alongside a new matching watch face and iPhone wallpaper. Beginning in February, all-new activations — including a series of Apple Maps Guides created by the Smithsonian, TV and film collections curated by Dr. Jelani Cobb, and more will be available to explore. Additionally, through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), Apple is expanding its support of five organizations focused on uplifting Black and Brown communities by unlocking creative potential through technology.
Apple Watch and iPhone
Members of Apple’s Black creative community and allies came together to develop this year’s Black Unity Collection and designed the new expressions inspired by the creative process of mosaic, celebrating the vibrancy of Black communities and the power of unity.
The Black Unity Sport Loop features the word “Unity” woven abstractly into the band using red, green, and black yarns that pay homage to the Pan-African flag, while a unique layering of yarns lends a sense of three-dimensionality to the letters. Additionally, the Unity Mosaic watch face incorporates geometric shapes in green, black, red, and yellow, and as the minutes change, each number uses pieces of other numbers to morph into new forms. iPhone users can also show their support with the new Unity wallpaper for their Lock Screen.
Apple is supporting Art Gallery of New South Wales (Sydney), Ghetto Film School (New York, Los Angeles, London), Music Forward (Los Angeles), Shout Mouse Press (Washington, D.C.), and The National Museum of African American Music (Nashville, Tennessee). Apple’s support for these organizations is a continuation of REJI grants over the past two years that helped organizations committed to providing economic, educational, and creative opportunities in communities of color.
App Store
The App Store will spotlight apps and games forging creative solutions for Black communities in areas such as music, banking, and gaming. Among these apps and games areDot’s Home, a 2022 App Store Award-winning game designed to educate users on housing disparities experienced in communities of color and financial wellness apps such asGoalsetter,Altro, andCapWaythat are empowering the community with financial resources. The App Store will also celebrate 50 years of hip-hop culture by spotlighting numerous apps that allow users to listen, watch, and learn the significance of this creative movement in both the past and present.
Apple Music
Apple Music will underscore the innumerable ways that Black artists have contributed to music and culture through healing, improvisation, reinvention, and so much more across all genres. TheFor Us, By Usplaylist will be updated to capture expressions of resilience and resistance, and users can also enjoy new episodes ofThe Messageand additional radio programming on Apple Music 1, Country, and HITS.
Apple TV App
Viewers can visit the Apple TV app to explore series and films curated by Dr. Jelani Cobb, dean of the Columbia University School of Journalism and a staff writer at The New Yorker. The theme of this year’s collections is “The Matter of Black Lives,” focusing on stories that illustrate three specific pillars: “Freedom in Black,” “Love in Spite Of,” and “The Mosaic.”
Apple Fitness+
Apple Fitness+ will share new workouts featuring playlists celebrating Black artists, as well as a new meditation dedicated to Black History Month led by Fitness+ trainer JoAnna Hardy. On January 30, Fitness+ will release a new episode of Time to Walk — an audio experience with some of the world’s most inspiring people — featuring legendary singer Patti LaBelle. On this walk, LaBelle talks about her famous cooking and the powerful role her late sister played in her life. That same day, Time to Run, an audio running experience featuring playlists and coaching designed to help users become more consistent and better runners, will introduce a new episode with Fitness+ trainer Cory Wharton-Malcolm, celebrating Black History Month with a run through South LA and songs from the artists who helped put West Coast hip-hop on the map.
Apple News
Throughout the month, Apple News will highlight compelling articles, interviews, and audio stories about the Black experience in America, including perspectives and analysis from top journalists. Curated collections will showcase stories from Black-led newsrooms, including Capital B, Essence, NewsOne, Howard University’s The Hilltop, and more.
Apple Podcasts
Every day, listeners open Apple Podcasts to hear from the world’s most inspiring and influential voices. And each year, Apple’s collections honoring Black History Month help listeners discover creators offering essential historical context and insightful perspectives on news and culture. Beginning February 1, Apple Podcasts will spotlight shows that embody the omnipresence of Blackness — the ways that Black music, media, spaces, and theory positively influence our understanding of the world and one another — from creators Bridget Todd, Bob the Drag Queen, Monét X Change, and Apple Music’s Ebro Darden.Listeners will also be able to explore a bespoke selection of podcast recommendations curated by Black disruptors — visionaries in their fields who resist the status quo to share beautiful art and innovation — such as environmental activist Leah Thomas.
Apple Books
During Black History Month, Apple Books will showcase its Read More Black Authorscollection, connecting readers and listeners with great books and audiobooks across different genres.
Apple Maps
The Smithsonian created a series of Guides in Apple Maps to spotlight key landmarks in the struggle for civil rights over the past century (1900-1957,1960-1978,1980-2020). Users can explore the Guides to learn more about the events, people, and places that have shaped the nation’s history.

2023-01-24,Increase,Apple builds on privacy commitment by unveiling new education and awareness efforts on Data Privacy Day,"Text of this article
January 24, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple builds on privacy commitment by unveiling new education and awareness efforts on Data Privacy Day
Cupertino, CaliforniaIn celebration of Data Privacy Day, Apple today unveiled a new set of educational resources designed to help users take control of their data.
As threats to the privacy and security of personal information are on the rise, a new Today at Apple session will educate users on how they can safeguard their data. And to drive awareness about the importance of data privacy, Apple has also partnered with Apple TV+Ted Lassostar Nick Mohammed in “A Day in the Life of an Average Person’s Data.”
These education efforts build on Apple’s long track record as a privacy leader, with innovations that give people more insight into how their data is used — and more tools to protect it. As a company that believes privacy is a fundamental human right, Apple designs features like App Tracking Transparency and Privacy Nutrition Labels, which put users in the driver’s seat when it comes to their data.
Protecting Users’ Privacy with Today at Apple
Beginning Saturday, January 28, a new Today at Apple session, “Taking Charge of Your Privacy on iPhone,” will explore features including Mail Privacy Protection, Safety Check, Location Services, and passkeys. In this session, attendees will learn how they can customize each feature based on their individual privacy preferences.
Today at Apple offers free creative sessions to help customers get the most out of their Apple products. This new 30-minute session will be available at all Apple Store locations around the world, and customers can now also sign up for Group Bookings and schedule a session for their group, organization, or class.
Anyone — regardless of experience level — can sign up for Today at Apple sessions at their local Apple Store by registering atapple.co/skills-privacy.
“We created Today at Apple to spark creativity and enable our customers to get the most out of their Apple products and features,” said Tracey Hannelly, Apple’s senior director of Retail Engagement and Marketing. “We’re thrilled to offer this new Today at Apple session to help our customers learn more about our industry-leading privacy features as we celebrate Data Privacy Day.”
Building in Privacy from the Ground Up
Privacy is built into all of Apple’s products and services from the ground up, from the moment users open their devices to every time they use an app. Apple products and features include innovative privacy technologies designed to minimize how much user data anyone can access.
This is why Safari throws trackers off the trail. It’s why the Health app keeps user records under wraps, and why Siri learns what the user needs rather than who they are. These are just some of the dozens of privacy features that Apple has built into the foundation of every product and every service it creates.
Apple believes that every user should have clear insights into how their data is used, and tools to decide when to share their data and who to share it with. The whimsical short film “A Day in the Life of an Average Person’s Data” invites users to follow Apple TV+Ted Lassostar Nick Mohammed through his average day, explaining how bad actors misuse data — and how Apple works to keep his personal information safe.
“At Apple, we’re focused on designing devices, features, and services that keep users in control of their personal data,” said Erik Neuenschwander, Apple’s director of User Privacy. “Over the years we’ve integrated powerful privacy controls into our operating systems. This film and our new Today at Apple sessions will show users how they can take advantage of some of the features we offer, and understand how privacy is at the center of everything we do.”
This commitment to transparency and control — and to privacy-protecting innovations across its technology — gives Apple users more choice and more control over their personal information. On Data Privacy Day and every day, teams across Apple are pushing this work forward. Learn more about Apple’s privacy features by visitingapple.com/privacy.

John Littles, McIntosh S.E.E.D. executive director

FEATURE
McIntosh S.E.E.D. preserves land and legacy with Black landowners in the US South
Apple and The Conservation Fund are partnering with community organizations across the region to scale sustainable land retention and climate resilience in Black and Brown communities
Throughout the Deep South, there are memories buried deep in the soil. For Junetta O’Neal, owner of the BoMax Ranch and Retreat in Crawfordville, Georgia, it’s a reminder of her ancestors, who toiled the earth for generations before she discovered her own love for nature the first time she saw a horse.
“When I first arrived at the BoMax, it was a very relaxing environment for me — one in which I could be at peace and one with nature,” O’Neal describes. “It kind of spoke to me, and I realized it was my ancestors that afforded me to be in the position that I’m in now. It’s their shoulders that I stand on to even be here. I started naming roads after them as a way to honor them. After hosting my cousins and having them feel connected to the land, it just reaffirmed that I was moving in the right direction with this project: establishing a legacy for our family.”
O’Neal is an enrollee in McIntosh S.E.E.D.’s Sustainable Forest & Land Retention program. She, along with 20 other landowners, visited the McIntosh S.E.E.D. Community Forest in Long County, Georgia, last December to participate in a forestry workshop. O’Neal, her fellow landowners, and their children and grandchildren met with forestry experts to learn the benefits of thinning trees, the importance of clearing underbrush, and how to measure and identify tree species to understand their economic value.
McIntosh S.E.E.D.’s 1,148-acre forest was acquired in 2015 in partnership with The Conservation Fund and is the first Black-owned community forest in the US. Through the educational work it does onsite, the nonprofit aims to amplify the voices of Black and Brown landowners in the conservation movement.
“We wanted a place where we could actually bring landowners, a demonstration site where they could see conservation practices,” says Cheryl Peterson, McIntosh S.E.E.D.’s assistant managing director. “It puts the landowner in a place of empowerment.”
The McIntosh County, Georgia-based nonprofit is one of many organizations across the US South that The Conservation Fund — in partnership with Apple — is working with to promote sustainable forestry, achieve racial justice, and establish climate resilience. Through workshops, trainings, and community-centric programming, McIntosh S.E.E.D. is developing a shared strategy for BIPOC land retention and improved climate practices that can be scaled throughout the region. By harnessing the thousands of family-owned farms and forests, and Black institutional landowners — primarily churches and historically Black colleges and universities — their efforts will help address climate change, supporting best practices for climate resilience and adaptation on privately held land.
“To promote justice and address climate change, we have to share resources and partner with organizations that have real on-the-ground expertise,” says Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “I’ve always believed the most powerful solutions come from centering the most vulnerable communities, not ignoring them. In places like McIntosh County, families are coming together to preserve the land that sustains all of us.”
Situated on the southern coast of Georgia, McIntosh County is indicative of several Southern BIPOC communities McIntosh S.E.E.D. is working to preserve.
“There are very few high-paying jobs or jobs that pay a living wage in the area,” Peterson explains. “It’s really hard for people here to change the trajectory of their families because they are capped at a certain level economically. I see it whether I’m in Georgia, Alabama, or Mississippi; all of those dynamics come along with being in a marginalized community.”
In the coastal city of Darien in McIntosh County — population just over 1,500 — the nonprofit has anchored itself to the area, focused on educating and empowering families and Black landowners in the surrounding region.
That work has included addressing the impacts of climate change, from severe drought and extreme heat that has led to lost crops, to stronger and more frequent tropical storms and hurricanes that force people to evacuate.
“People have lost their homes and have had to move because they couldn’t afford to get their homes repaired after a flood or after trees have fallen on their property,” Peterson says. “As a result of these environmental factors, a lot of families are put in harm’s way because if they do have to evacuate, a lot of them can’t afford to leave. As more and more harsh weather comes in, it’s going to be detrimental to our area, especially for folks here on the coast.”
While McIntosh S.E.E.D. started out focused on the coastal county’s specific needs in 1998, Peterson and executive director John Littles always envisioned scaling its work to uplift more communities across the Deep South.
“We didn’t want to operate off of that ‘crabs in a basket’ syndrome where one gets out and another reaches up while the others pull it back down,” Peterson says. “We wanted to link arms and pull out as many marginalized people and communities as we could, and we still operate under that guiding principle.”
As part of their early work with agricultural producers and landowners, Littles and Peterson traveled deeper into the South throughout Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama. They started to notice just how different forested land looked in wealthier, predominantly white areas compared to the impoverished, predominantly Black communities.
While researching available land management resources for the landowners McIntosh S.E.E.D. was already working with, Littles realized it wasn’t just lack of awareness contributing to the degradation of the land in BIPOC communities; it was also cultural.
“In our community, property has been looked at as a liability, not an asset,” Littles explains. “We also learned a lot of injustice was being done in our community; folks would come in and not give the right price on our timber, or the right acreage, and they would just destroy the landscape when they cut the timber. It wasn’t a good look for our community, or the environment.”
Over the last decade, McIntosh S.E.E.D. has partnered with The Conservation Fund to identify opportunities for sustainable land management through land protection that benefits both nature and its neighboring communities.
“The loss of forests both to development and being converted out of forests results in the release of significant carbon,” says Evan Smith, The Conservation Fund’s senior vice president of Conservation Ventures. “This contributes to climate change, and also reduces the land’s ability to respond and adapt to climate change.”
In the South, addressing the injustice in Black and Brown communities is key.
“It’s a sort of twin effect of the US South, as one of the largest sources of carbon emissions in the US, but also because of the loss of forests, which are an incredibly powerful tool for slowing climate change,” Smith explains. “And then at the same time, these populations are uniquely susceptible to displacement and impact because of climate change.”
As The Conservation Fund started exploring opportunities in the South, it recognized McIntosh S.E.E.D.’s efforts to home in on the intersectionality of race, environment, and community. McIntosh S.E.E.D.’s grassroots programs were already designed to strengthen local communities, help them understand and address environmental impacts on their homes, gain access to natural resources, and educate and empower landowners with whatever tools they may need on their ownership journeys.
“When people are low wealth, there are many issues they don’t take an interest in because they have so many other challenges,” explains Littles. “So it starts with education around climate — how it affects them, their land, and the community, but also how do we as landowners play a role in climate change and become better stewards of that?”
At the community forest, Peterson is commanding the attention of the workshop’s attendees and speaking directly to the young people in attendance about their responsibility to their families’ land once it is passed on. She seems at one with the forest, acknowledging its benefits, its value, and the importance of keeping land for future generations.
“Traditionally, we don’t have many Black forestry professionals,” Peterson says. “We want to build forestry, and we want to introduce our children to it so that they can pursue it as an option of future employment if they decide to, but in order for that to happen, they have to have that connection to the land.”
Peterson’s commitment to uplifting families and communities stems from her ancestors, who instilled in her an innate desire to be of service to others. “She talked to us about the importance of sharing,” she recalls of her great-grandmother, who would carefully break one stick of gum into enough pieces to share with Peterson and her 12 cousins. That story would go on to be told at family gatherings for generations as a reminder to always be giving, regardless of how much the family had.
“I’m not going to be here forever,” Peterson says, “so to be able to pass this knowledge on assures me that long after I’m gone, future generations will retain the land. My great-grandfather worked in the pulpwood business, and whatever it is that my family owns is off of his hard work. The calluses on his hands, as well as the many other families whose ancestors had calluses on their hands and scars on their backs — they did that for us to be able to have this land. It’s up to us to continue their legacy.”

UPDATE
With Apple Watch, researchers explore new frontiers in heart health
In a single day, the heart of an average, healthy adult beats more than 100,000 times. Beat by beat, day by day, a picture begins to emerge — an image that goes largely unseen. Apple Watch can help make the invisible, visible. With heart health features — including high and low heart notifications, Cardio Fitness, irregular rhythm notifications, the ECG app, and AFib History — Apple gives users an ever-developing view of their health with actionable insights.
The same advanced technology that provides insights to help users better understand their health also has the potential to open the door to discovery for the research and medical communities. Since Apple launched ResearchKit and CareKit in 2015, researchers, clinicians, and developers have found innovative new ways to study, track, and treat a broad range of conditions.
To further drive discoveries that improve health at scale, Apple launched theInvestigator Support Program. Through this program, Apple provides researchers with Apple Watch devices, enabling them to break new ground in health research, including the scientific understanding of the heart.
Apple is spotlighting the cutting-edge work of health researchers around the world who are using Apple Watch to study the heart like never before.
Associate professor Rachel Conyers and Dr. Claudia Toro are senior pediatric oncologists from Melbourne, Australia, primarily spending their days caring for children in a tertiary pediatric oncology clinic and researching toxicities related to children’s cancer therapies within theMurdoch Children’s Research Institute. Together they are looking at how treatment can impact heart rhythm and are trying to identify innovative ways to intervene. The inspiration for their work comes from their patients — both success stories and heartbreak.
Toxicities in cancer treatment can lead to heart rhythm disturbances, such as prolonged QT syndrome, which can be potentially life-threatening. Prolonged QT creates an irregular heart rhythm, increasing the time needed for blood to flow through the heart.
Because of their susceptibility to long QT, children receiving cancer treatment are routinely screened at least once per week with a 12-lead electrocardiogram, according to Dr. Conyers. However, outpatients still need access to monitoring.
“I read about the Apple Heart Study and I thought this could be important for pediatrics,” said Dr. Conyers. “We used to think of cardiac toxicity as something that happened 10 years after treatment. But now we know that new cancer therapies (like specific inhibitors or immune therapy) can cause arrhythmias within 48 hours of medication — so there’s a big gap in terms of what we know about the toxicities at the moment.”
In the coming months,Dr. Conyers and her teamat the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute will begin with researching the sensitivity of the Apple Watch ECG app in 40 children and adolescent patients.1From there, the team will look for ways for patients to take their ECGs wherever they are, whenever they’re able. With those insights, the team hopes to better understand the reality of cardiac toxicity and identify potential opportunities for intervention.
Every Bay Area resident remembers the day the sky turned orange. It happened September 9, 2020. Dr. So-Min Cheong, an associate professor in the Public Service & Administration Department at the Bush School, Texas A&M University, was in Palo Alto, California.
“I still have photos of that day on my iPhone,” said Dr. Cheong.
California experienced a series of devastating wildfires in 2020 and 2021. Dr. Cheong, who researches the social and health consequences of environmental disasters and climate change, saw an opportunity to study the personal impact of wildfire smoke on cardiac health in firefighters.
“General health recommendations or off-the-shelf interventions weren’t good enough for me,” Dr. Cheong explains. “People are unique. Each individual is different when it concerns their health, and I wanted to learn more.”
Through her connections in the research community, Dr. Cheong learned that Apple Watch could help capture the kind of health data she needed. “A colleague of mine at Stanford had shared their experience using Apple Watch, and it’s known for its heart rate accuracy,” she adds. “I had always wanted to be able to do more noninvasive, sensor-based analysis on individuals to get at more precise health measurements.”
Next month, Dr. Cheong at Texas A&M University and Drs. Brian Kim and Marco Perez at Stanford Medicine will begin equipping firefighters with Apple Watch to study the impact of wildfire smoke on heart health. Wildfire season begins in spring in Texas and summer in California, and up to 200 firefighters in these locations will join the study.
From Apple Watch, the study plans to monitor heart rate and rhythm, sleep, blood oxygen, activity data, and more. Firefighters will also wear an air quality monitor and complete surveys related to sleep, activity, and wildfire smoke-related symptoms.
“Firefighters are bound to benefit from the study,” Dr. Cheong shares. “We know wildfire smoke directly affects their health and with a study like this, they’ll be able to see their results in real time.”
But she doesn’t want to generalize what the study’s potential findings are at this point, particularly when the core focus of the research is looking at the kind of individualized and precision health data that Apple Watch can provide.
“Studies like this one haven’t been done before, so it’s not a matter of proving or disproving a hypothesis,” said Dr. Cheong. “It’s more exploratory and the outcomes will help us understand the accuracy of an analysis like this to generate tailored interventions. I also think a study of this nature could help us understand high risk groups better.”
According to epidemiology experts in Europe, the estimated rate of atrial fibrillation (AFib) in the European Union is expected to double by 2060. AFib is a common heart arrhythmia that can have serious impacts — such as a higher risk of stroke or heart failure — if left untreated.
At the Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Dr. Sebastiaan Blok, director of eHealth at the Cardiology Centers of the Netherlands, and his colleagues are exploring ways to detect AFib earlier. The researchers have developed a randomized controlled study as part of a larger initiative called HartWacht, the first reimbursable eHealth concept.
In the Netherlands, “There are about 300,000 people who have been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation,” said Dr. Nicole van Steijn, an investigator on the research team. “But there’s also an estimated 100,000 people who have it but don’t know, likely because they haven’t experienced symptoms.”
As part of their study, they plan to enroll more than 300 patients over the age of 65 who meet a risk threshold for AFib. Half of the participants — the intervention group — will wear Apple Watch for at least 12 hours per day.
“Apple Watch is such a widely used, reliable consumer wearable that we thought it would be a great device for us to integrate into our research to better understand how we could potentially integrate it into the larger health system,” Dr. Blok shares.
As part of the group’s study design, participants are expected to take an ECG once every three weeks, or if they begin feeling symptoms. If the participant receives an irregular rhythm notification, the researchers will connect with the participant and instruct them to take an ECG and share the results.
Within three weeks of the study, researchers were able to identify a participant with AFib in the intervention group who wasn’t experiencing any symptoms.
This study marks the beginning of what they hope to understand using Apple Watch. In the future, they plan to explore ways to identify possible opportunities to use the ECG app to monitor patients from home, as certain medications can alter a heart rhythm. They’re also considering how Apple Watch could possibly be used to monitor heart failure patients from home, given it’s a costly disease, and identify predictive biomarkers for exacerbations.
“We are continuing to grow and innovate with new opportunities, based in science and technology,” said Dr. Blok.

UPDATE
Preliminary findings from the Apple Women’s Health Study help advance the conversation and science around menstrual cycles
Moving menstrual health forward with iPhone and Apple Watch
Ahead of International Women’s Day, new preliminary findings from the Apple Women’s Health Study underscore the importance of paying attention to menstrual cycles and their connection to overall health.
Many physicians consider periods a vital sign, but this area of health is notably under-researched. TheApple Women’s Health Studyis a first-of-its-kind research study conducted with the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) that aims to advance the understanding of menstrual cycles and how they relate to various health conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), infertility, and menopausal transition. The study is significant in its scope and scale because it invites anyone who has ever menstruated across the US to contribute to this research simply by using their iPhone.
New Preliminary Findings
Harvard Chan School researchers used survey data from the Apple Women’s Health Study to advance the scientific understanding around the relationship between persistently abnormal periods, PCOS, and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Looking at a preliminary analysis cohort of over 50,000 study participants, the study team found:
These updates are a first step for helping people understand risk factors for these diseases, and encouraging people to have conversations with their healthcare providers about cycle irregularity earlier.
“More awareness on menstrual cycle physiology and the impact of irregular periods and PCOS on uterine health is needed,” said Dr. Shruthi Mahalingaiah, MS, Harvard Chan School’s assistant professor of Environmental Reproductive and Women’s Health and co-principal investigator of the Apple Women’s Health Study. “This analysis highlights the importance of talking to a healthcare provider when menstruators are experiencing persistent changes to their period that span many months. Over time, we hope our research can lead to new strategies to reduce disease risk and improve health across the lifespan.”
The study team will conduct further analyses on this preliminary data for scientific publication.
Previous Interim Updates
The Apple Women’s Health Study team has previously shared a number of other interim research updates that highlight how large-scale, longitudinal research on menstruation can help advance the science around this topic.
The Apple Women’s Health Study invites anyone who has ever menstruated across the US to contribute to scientific research by enrolling via the Apple Research app. The study enables participants to share their cycle tracking data, along with other health data from iPhone, and Apple Watch if they have one. Participants can also provide a more well-rounded set of information about their personal and family history and lifestyle through occasional surveys. The Research app helps the study reach individuals across various stages of their life, varying races, and across the US. Participants control the data types shared with the study, with transparency into how the data will be used for the purposes of the study.
Cycle Tracking on iPhone and Apple Watch
Cycle Tracking is available in the Health app on iPhone or the Cycle Tracking app on Apple Watch, allowing users to track their menstrual cycle along with details like symptoms or ovulation test results. Cycle Tracking uses information users have logged for previous periods and cycle length, plus heart rate data from Apple Watch, to offer period and fertile window predictions. Users can turn on notifications to tell them when their next period or fertile window is approaching.
With iOS 16 and watchOS 9, Cycle Tracking can inform users if their logged cycle history from the previous six months shows a pattern of irregular periods, infrequent periods, prolonged periods, or persistent spotting. It’s important to know when these patterns occur, as they may be a sign of an underlying health condition. Users are also able to learn about the Cycle Deviation detected, and export the last 12 months of their cycle history as a PDF to share with their provider.
Additionally, the new temperature-sensing capabilities in Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra allow users to receive retrospective ovulation estimates. New sensors gather overnight wrist temperature data that can be used to estimate the likely day of ovulation after it has occurred and improve period predictions. Knowing when ovulation has occurred can be helpful for family planning, and users can view these estimates in the Health app.
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s iPhone is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.

Groundbreaking Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind
iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus offer critical safety capabilities that can provide emergency assistance when it matters most. Emergency SOS via satellite allows users to message with emergency services when cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available through a combination of custom-designed components and deeply integrated software. Additionally, if users want to reassure friends and family of their whereabouts while off the grid, they can open the Find My app and share their location via satellite. This service — which has already helped users in emergency situations in the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the U.K. — will come to Austria, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal later this month.4
Crash Detection on the iPhone 14 lineup can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone. Apple-designed motion algorithms trained with over a million hours of real-world driving and crash record data combine with motion inputs from the new accelerometer and gyroscope, GPS, barometer, and microphone5on iPhone to bring this innovative safety feature to life. When paired with Apple Watch, Crash Detection seamlessly leverages the unique strength of both devices to get users help efficiently.6

The 6-core CPU with two performance and four efficiency cores handles intensive tasks with ease, and the 16-core Neural Engine is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features in iOS 16 and third-party app experiences.
Featuring iOS 16
iOS 16 features the biggest update ever to the Lock Screen, with a multilayered effect that artfully sets subjects of photos in front of the time, widgets that offer information at a glance, and a new wallpaper gallery for inspiration. Focus gets even more powerful with a new way to connect to the Lock Screen and create Focus filters within apps. Live Activities help users stay on top of things that are happening in real time, such as a sports game or ride-share, right from the Lock Screen. In Messages, users can edit a message, undo send, and mark conversations as unread.7Browsing in Safari gets even safer with passkeys, a next-generation credential that can’t be phished or leaked. Live Text adds the ability to interact with text in video, quickly convert currency, and translate text. Users can also tap and hold on the subject of an image to lift it from the background and place it in apps like Messages. iCloud Shared Photo Library offers a new way to seamlessly share photos with up to six family members. And with Apple Music Sing, users can sing along to their favorite songs with adjustable vocals and real-time lyrics.8
iPhone and the Environment
iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus are designed to minimize their impact on the environment, including antenna lines that use upcycled plastic water bottles that have been chemically transformed into a stronger, higher-performance material. In addition to featuring a re-architected internal design that offers improved repairability, iPhone 14 models also use 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, including those in MagSafe, and 100 percent recycled tungsten in the Taptic Engine. Both models also include 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards and in the wire of all cameras. Fiber-based packaging does not use outer plastic wrap, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be 100 percent carbon neutral across its entire manufacturing supply chain and all product life cycles. This means that every Apple device sold, from component manufacturing, assembly, transport, customer use, charging, all the way through recycling and material recovery, will have net-zero climate impact.

Meet four women using apps and games to drive culture and create change
The teams at Rebel Girls, Dinosaur Polo Club, and Wisdom share how their experiences shaped the vision for their apps and games on the App Store
Every day on the App Store, entrepreneurs behind best-in-class apps and games are harnessing the power and accessibility of technology to create change and drive culture. And for the creators of Mini Motorways, Rebel Girls, and Wisdom, there’s so much more to app development than the end product — these women-led teams are amplifying women’s voices, and leading the charge for the next generation of women and girls looking to cultivate a career in technology.
After attending Stanford Graduate School of Business where she studied the stories behind the world’s greatest tech companies, Jes Wolfe knew she wanted to pursue a career in the industry. Today, she serves as the CEO ofRebel Girls, a global media brand that empowers girls through the stories of pioneering women. Through the company’s app — a winner ofApple’s 2022 Design Awards— as well as its podcast and books, the company aims to inspire young women to dream big.
In their leadership roles at New Zealand-based game development studio Dinosaur Polo Club, Niamh Fitzgerald and Chantelle Cole set out to build a more inclusive workplace, fostering an environment where everyone can flourish and feel valued. Designed by a diverse development team, their titles like the Apple Arcade hitMini Motorwaysencourage users to take a closer look at the world around them and problem-solve in creative and unusual ways.
Dayo Akinrinade, a participant in Apple’s 2022 Entrepreneur Camp for Black Founders, felt underrepresented and underestimated in the world of computer science after graduating from the University of Manchester — so she built her own community designed to prioritize and amplify women’s voices. Her audio-first social discovery app,Wisdom, connects like-minded users for deep conversations on far-ranging topics like careers, relationships, and fitness.
Below, Wolfe, Fitzgerald, Cole, and Akinrinade share how they use technology to uplift women and create social change.
What kinds of challenges do you address with your company and its products?
Jes Wolfe (JW), CEO of Rebel Girls:We see a confidence gap between genders starting at age 6. That’s when girls start to think they are less smart and less capable than boys, according to a study published byScience.The study says career aspirations are shaped by gender stereotypes. Additionally, between the ages of 8 and 14, girls’ confidence falls by 30 percent. We want every girl to open the Rebel Girls app — or any of our books — and find dozens of stories of role models that she can see herself in.
Dayo Akinrinade (DA), founder of Wisdom:My aim for Wisdom is to replace the inequity of closed networks with an open, diverse community of experts and helpful people. Wisdom offers women a safe space to converse about topics that matter to them, such as women’s rights, domestic violence, leadership, and wellness. Our users who don’t identify as women consider themselves allies, and provide support by participating in the conversations or simply listening.
Niamh Fitzgerald (NF), chief operating officer of Dinosaur Polo Club:Many women face issues such as pay and gender equality, barriers to leadership, and inflexible work hours. But we believe that creating a work environment that is inclusive and supportive for everyone — regardless of their gender or sexuality — is fundamental to creating a sustainable and thriving business. Advocating for diversity and inclusion is at the heart of everything we do, but we hope that one day we’ll reach a point where this is commonplace in every business.
How have you seen your user community benefit from your product?
Chantelle Cole (CC), CEO of Dinosaur Polo Club:Initially, we set out to make something that would connect with people who held an appreciation for real-world systems — something that might encourage them to look at the world around them with fresh eyes and perhaps seek more elegant solutions to everyday problems. We never anticipated the way our games have become a positive and meaningful part of people’s lives.
JW:We develop all our content and our app for 4- to 12-year-old girls. Our storytelling empowers and inspires them, and helps them build their confidence, and we do it in a way that the whole family can enjoy. Eighty-six percent of parents tell us their girls’ confidence has increased because of Rebel Girls, and 92 percent of parents tell us our stories inspired their girls.
How have your experiences influenced how you’ve created your app and how you run your business?
CC:My experiences working across creative industries — including music and printing — began to shape who I wanted to be as a leader. I wanted to take the best parts of [people] who had inspired me through their values-based and selfless leadership, and create a culture that fosters mental well-being, values diversity, and directly addresses inequity.
DA:In my time working with minority founders, I witnessed how a lack of social capital contributes to systemic inequity and disadvantages founders from minority groups, hence the inspiration for Wisdom. We’re growing an open and diverse community where the conversations center on advice and personal development.
JW:Early in my career, I read Carly Fiorina’s memoir,Tough Choices, and gobbled up each page. As one of the first books I’d read about a female CEO, it inspired me. My favorite question to ask people is, “Who is a woman who inspires you?” It’s disappointing how few people can answer that question. Women are still fighting to tell their stories, and to have them told authentically. This is why we tell the stories of women representing 400+ professions and from 100+ countries; we work with hundreds of female and nonbinary writers, illustrators, editors, and narrators to tell these stories authentically.
What features in your app did you design to uplift and empower girls or women?
NF:We like to call our community of players City Planners or Civil Engineers, which, in real life, is a field dominated by men. For young girls, picking up a game that was intentionally designed for all ages and genders might open up the idea to them that urban design and high-level strategy are things they can find a passion for. It’s important to us as a studio that our games feel approachable and welcoming for all demographics, so if they can be confidence-inspiring for a young woman, that’s a success!
JW:Confidence is the biggest predictor of a child’s future success, and girls have less of it than boys do. Media plays a big role, and Rebel Girls is leading to change the narrative and tone. We have a content ecosystem where girls are portrayed in realistic situations where they are winning, surrounded by a supportive community and friends, and not confronted by gendered language.
DA:Wisdom is a place to ask questions and learn from extraordinary women from different walks of life — women you would ordinarily never have the chance to meet. Any woman can start a talk or engage in Q&A on a topic that matters to them, and it’s free. This is by design, so that everyone can have a voice. We also considered safety from the start: We intentionally add friction to the signup process, have 24/7 moderators, and make it easy to report a piece of content. We leverage AI to algorithmically score our user-generated content to reduce the probability of posting harmful content.
What do you hope for the next generation of women technologists?
DA:I hope the next generation of women technologists are able to show up as their authentic selves and thrive in a technology field that accommodates for a variety of diverse leadership styles. After all, leadership is not one size fits all.
JW:Female founders secured 2 percent of venture capital in the U.S. in 2022. I want to see women founders, creators, and developers seeing at least 50 percent of venture funding to make their products, impact societies, create jobs, and build the future.
NF:My hope for the next generation of women is that a focus on gender diversity and inclusion becomes a natural part of how every company does business, not something that sets it apart. So many areas of our lives involve some aspect of technology, and it just makes sense to have a wide range of people and perspectives involved when we’re innovating towards a future that works for everyone.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces Apple Pay Later to allow consumers to pay for purchases over time
Apple Pay users can split purchases into four payments with zero interest and no fees
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introduced Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Designed with users’ financial health in mind, Apple Pay Later1allows users to split purchases into four payments, spread over six weeks with no interest and no fees.2Users can easily track, manage, and repay their Apple Pay Later loans in one convenient location in Apple Wallet. Users can apply for Apple Pay Later loans of $50 to $1,000, which can be used for online and in-app purchases made on iPhone and iPad with merchants that accept Apple Pay.3Starting today, Apple will begin inviting select users to access a prerelease version of Apple Pay Later, with plans to offer it to all eligible users in the coming months.
“There’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to how people manage their finances. Many people are looking for flexible payment options, which is why we’re excited to provide our users with Apple Pay Later,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “Apple Pay Later was designed with our users’ financial health in mind, so it has no fees and no interest, and can be used and managed within Wallet, making it easier for consumers to make informed and responsible borrowing decisions.”
Apply for, Track, and Manage Loans Seamlessly in Wallet
To get started with Apple Pay Later, users can apply for a loan within Wallet with no impact to their credit.4They will then be prompted to enter the amount they would like to borrow and agree to the Apple Pay Later terms. A soft credit pull will be done during the application process to help ensure the user is in a good financial position before taking on the loan.
After a user is approved, they will see the Pay Later option when they select Apple Pay at checkout online and in apps on iPhone and iPad, and can use Apple Pay Later to make a purchase. Once Apple Pay Later is set up, users can also apply for a loan directly in the checkout flow when making a purchase.
Apple Pay Later is built right into Wallet, so users can seamlessly view, track, and manage all of their loans in one place. With Apple Pay Later in Wallet, users can easily see the total amount due for all of their existing loans, as well as the total amount due in the next 30 days. They can also choose to see all upcoming payments on a calendar view in Wallet to help them track and plan their payments. Before a payment is due, users will also receive notifications via Wallet and email so they can plan accordingly. Users will be asked to link a debit card from Wallet as their loan repayment method; to help prevent users from taking on more debt to pay back loans, credit cards will not be accepted.
Apple Pay Later was designed with privacy and security at its core. Purchases using Apple Pay Later are authenticated using Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode, and users’ transaction and loan history are never shared or sold to third parties for marketing or advertising.
Apple Pay Later is offered by Apple Financing LLC, a subsidiary of Apple Inc., which is responsible for credit assessment and lending. Apple Financing plans to report Apple Pay Later loans to U.S. credit bureaus starting this fall,5so they are reflected in users’ overall financial profiles and can help promote responsible lending for both the lender and the borrower.
Mastercard and Goldman Sachs
Apple Pay Later is enabled through the Mastercard Installments program, so merchants that accept Apple Pay do not need to do anything to implement Apple Pay Later for their customers. When a merchant accepts Apple Pay, Apple Pay Later will be an option for their customers during checkout online and in apps on iPhone and iPad. Goldman Sachs is the issuer of the Mastercard payment credential used to complete Apple Pay Later purchases.
Availability
Starting today, randomly selected users will be invited to get early access to a prerelease version of Apple Pay Later via Wallet and through their Apple ID email. Apple Pay Later is available in the U.S. for online and in-app purchases on iPhone and iPad.Apple Pay Later is available with iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4.

March 28, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple Music Classical is here
The ultimate classical music streaming experience is available to Apple Music subscribers at no additional cost; download it now on the App Store
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today launched Apple Music Classical, a brand-new standalone music streaming app designed to deliver the listening experience classical music lovers deserve. With Apple Music Classical, Apple Music subscribers can easily find any recording in the world’s largest classical music catalog with fully optimized search; enjoy the highest audio quality available and experience many classical favorites in a whole new way with immersive Spatial Audio; browse expertly curated playlists, insightful composer biographies, and descriptions of thousands of works; and so much more.Apple Music Classicalis available on the App Store beginning today and is included at no extra cost with nearly all Apple Music subscriptions. The combination of Apple Music Classical and Apple Music provides a complete music experience for everyone, from longtime classical fans to first-time listeners, and everyone in between.
“We love music — that’s really what we’re all about — and classical music is foundational to music of all genres,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “Apple Music Classical is a dedicated app that is great for classical experts as well as anyone who is new to classical, with the largest classical music selection in the world, the very best search and browse capabilities, the most premium sound experience with Spatial Audio, and thousands of exclusive recordings. We believe this is the very best classical music streaming experience available anywhere, and for us, this is just the beginning.”
The World’s Largest Classical Music Catalog
With over 5 million tracks, Apple Music Classical is home to the world’s largest classical music catalog, covering the whole spectrum from celebrated recordings to forgotten gems. For beginners, the hand-picked Editor’s Choice curation is a great place to start. And for those more familiar with a particular work, the app’s list of popular recordings provides the perfect next step — and an enjoyable chance to compare and contrast. Apple Music Classical also features thousands of exclusive albums, including recordings by world-famous orchestras.
Search Built for Classical Music
Classical works have multiple movements and tracks; famous pieces have hundreds of recordings with different orchestras, conductors, and soloists; and many composers have their own special catalog classifications, from Bach’s BWV to Mozart’s K. With these complexities in mind, Apple Music Classical has redesigned search to instantly deliver exactly what users are looking for using all combinations of keywords, from composer and work, to opus number, conductor, artist, or instrument, and even a work’s nickname. Looking up a work reveals all its recordings, plus an Editor’s Choice performance. And searching for a composer displays all available works.
An Interface Designed for Classical
The Apple Music Classical interface ensures listeners always know who and what they’re hearing, with everything laid out at a glance: work name, orchestra, conductor, contributing artists, and even year of recording. And when it comes to curating a personal library, Apple Music Classical lets listeners add more than just albums, tracks, playlists, and artists — it also supports uniquely classical categories such as works, composers, and recordings.
The Highest Audio Quality
Apple Music Classical features lossless audio of up to 24 bit/192 kHz throughout the service so listeners can experience the nuances of every performance. In Hi-Res Lossless mode, sound is so astoundingly crisp and clear that each note feels close enough to touch. And thanks to revolutionary Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos, listeners can enjoy thousands of recordings from the best seat in the concert hall, immersed in a 360-degree soundscape where music comes from every direction, including above. Apple Music Classical’s Spatial Audio catalog adds new albums every week as legendary recordings are remastered and contemporary performances are captured in Spatial Audio.
Expert Recommendations and Classical Insights
Apple Music Classical’s editors have created over 700 playlists to guide listeners through 800 years of music, and more will be added. Beginners can start with The Story of Classical audio guides, which blend expert commentary and selected works to introduce key composers, periods, instruments, and classical terminology. For devotees, there’s the chance to go behind the scenes of selected recordings as leading classical artists offer track-by-track audio commentary. Plus, every week, Apple Music Classical’s hand-picked Hidden Gems highlight a selection of lesser-known works, while Composer Undiscovered playlists bring a new perspective to famous names.
Exploration Made Easy
Apple Music Classical’s Browse tab helps listeners explore the largest classical catalog in the world, guided by their interests, from composers, instruments, and periods, to conductors, orchestras, and choirs, as well as classical genres such as chamber music and stage works. With so many ways to explore, there are limitless possibilities for finding new favorites.
Exclusive New Artwork
Apple Music Classical listeners will also enjoy exclusive brand-new artwork, including hundreds of playlist covers, as well as unique, high-resolution digital portraits for many of the world’s greatest composers. Commissioned from a diverse group of artists, each image blends historical research with color palettes and artistic references from the relevant classical period. With the majority of these new works designed on Mac and iPad, the results display an attention to detail, bringing listeners face to face with leading classical figures like Bach, Beethoven, Hildegard von Bingen, Chopin, John Dowland, Fanny Mendelssohn, Shostakovich, Tchaikovsky, Vivaldi, and so many others unlike ever before.
Additionally, Apple Music has partnered with many of the greatest classical institutions in the world — including the Berlin Philharmonic, Carnegie Hall, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, Opéra national de Paris, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony, and the Vienna Philharmonic — to bring Apple Music Classical listeners new, unique, and exclusive content and recordings at launch and beyond. Apple Music Classical will also host several live performances featuring a few of these incredible partners at Apple Store locations around the world as part of the Today at Apple programming beginning in March 2023. To sign up for Today at Apple events, visitapple.com/today.
Apple Music is also working closely with some of today’s most renowned classical composers, artists, and musicians to ensure that the app is empowering artists and engaging classical music lovers all over the world.
Cellist Yo-Yo Ma was involved in early conversations about the need for such an app, and is delighted that listeners will have new ways to access and explore the world of classical music. “Classical music — and all of culture — is fundamentally about connection, about forging bonds of understanding across time and space,” said Yo-Yo Ma. “It’s innovations like this that make that connection possible, that give us space for our curiosity to run, to rediscover the familiar, and to rejoice in the unexpected.”
“I’m thrilled that Apple Music is taking the initiative to set a new standard for classical music in the streaming age,” said Hilary Hahn. “I know that I can trust Apple Music’s natively high-quality uncompressed audio to convey the subtleties of my performance, my instrument, and the space in which it’s played. And even a solo classical recording is a deeply collaborative process; Apple Music Classical’s extensive metadata ensures that everyone — composers, arrangers, conductors, musicians, producers, publishers, and more — gets the credit they deserve.”
“I’ve been working with Apple to help solve the problems of classical music streaming,” said Jonny Greenwood. “They’ve come up with a really elegant set of solutions to the unique problems that hinder the search for — and collection of — digital classical music. Put simply, there’s only one recording of Joni Mitchell’s ‘Blue,’ but thousands of ‘Rhapsody in Blue.’ This first kind of search, in someone newly interested in classical music, can be so off-putting and bewildering, so I’m very excited for everyone to finally have a way into this remarkable universe of music, which is welcoming to new (and old) classical fans, and which rewards enthusiasm for music with music, directly and intuitively.”
“Music is the focus of my life, and as a composer and supporter, I have long believed it is essential to our humanity,” said Gordon P. Getty. “The advent of Apple Music Classical is an extraordinary moment in our profession. It is an exceptional streaming service that celebrates diverse artists, embraces legendary recordings, and inspires curiosity in all of us. Apple has created a unique experience worthy of our passion, and I am confident it will advance the cause of music for generations to come.”

At Exceptional Minds, autistic artists turn creativity into careers
With support from Apple, the Los Angeles-based nonprofit and academy is preparing a new generation of animators, VFX artists, and motion graphics designers
Growing up in Burbank, California, Angela Ibarra always knew she wanted to be an artist.
“My mind has always been popping out really creative stuff — endlessly,” Ibarra explains. “I thought, ‘I need to put this on paper and let it come to life.’ I draw stuff and it becomes what it wants.”
Ibarra pulls up an illustration of a Renaissance-era figure interpreted through an anime aesthetic. She’s been using Procreate with Apple Pencil on iPad for years to hone her craft, with a dream of someday working as an animator or visual effects artist in Hollywood.
Ibarra is in her first year atExceptional Minds, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit academy and studio founded in 2011, where she and her fellow students can often be found working in the lab, taking figure drawing classes, and learning how to render motion graphics. Using products and technology provided in part by Apple’s community grants program, the school trains neurodivergent artists for employability in entertainment through a blend of technical training, hands-on experience, and career-path planning.
“Exceptional Minds is so unique in the way it works with students on the autism spectrum,” says Tim Dailey, the school’s academic dean and director of academic programs. “We want to create a world where a student on the spectrum is recognized for their talents and not the challenges they face.”
In just a few short years, alumni have gone on to land jobs at industry powerhouses like Marvel, Nickelodeon, and Cartoon Network, and these successes are a testament to the school’s approach. At Exceptional Minds, students have the freedom and flexibility they need to go at their own pace, while still being accountable to the rigors of a three-year program — a methodology that sets it apart from the more traditional schools students might have attended growing up. Feedback is plentiful, designed to help artists set reasonable expectations for themselves and their work.
The school’s instructors confide that they learn just as much from their students. “There’s a saying that we like to say: ‘If you know one person with autism, you know one person with autism,’” explains Jessica “Jess” Jerome, a professional animator who has taught at Exceptional Minds for almost a decade. “I’ve learned from my students that not all of them learn the same way. So I have to find different ways to make sure that whatever I’m trying to get across gets across.”
At the school, students learn specific technical tools and skills that will help them be successful as animation, motion graphics, visual effects, and 3D artists once they graduate and enter the competitive Hollywood job hunt.
This means both career readiness courses and training on current, industry-standard hardware and software. Students are introduced to the Adobe Creative Suite of apps on Mac — including Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere, and Animate — in their first year, and for many, the Procreate app on iPad allows them the freedom to create beyond the classroom. Students also stay on top of daily tasks with productivity apps like Finch and Zinnia, available on iPhone, and can improve focus using Apple’s built-in cognitive accessibility features like Background Sounds or Guided Access.
Students particularly enjoy the combination of iPad and Apple Pencil for their creative process. “It bridges the gap between physical drawing and digital art,” says Matthew Rohde, a second-year aiming for a career in visual effects or motion design. “That’s what makes it so great. I’ve tried using other styluses, and there’s sort of that disconnect.”
“Apple Pencil has pressure sensitivity,” adds Matthew Rada, a third-year student at Exceptional Minds. “When you lean the pencil this way, it’ll act like an actual pencil and do certain shading in the way a regular pencil does.”
Adjacent to their technical training, students complete three years of vocational training, including a Career Realities track that builds on their skills in resume writing, portfolio building, career planning, interviewing, and other life skills to help them succeed in future roles in the industry. Through mentorship and internship programs, students begin to develop relationships with employers, and those employers begin to learn about their needs or working styles.
“Our artists learn how to hone their voice so they have better opportunities and better networking,” Jerome adds. “We’re not changing their stories; we’re just making it possible for people to see their stories.”
For students like Ibarra, Rohde, and Rada, that means that by the time they leave Exceptional Minds, goals like pitching comic books to DC or working as a motion designer for a major studio aren’t just dreams — they’re well within reach.

Behind the :br(s):scenes of MLS Season Pass: Celebrating the sights and sounds of Matchday
On a brisk Sunday afternoon in March, the freshly watered pitch at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles glistens, a fresh coat of paint marking its boundaries. As a crew of dozens of producers, broadcasters, and technical staff ready for kickoff at the match between defending MLS champions Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) and the New England Revolution, a drumbeat is rumbling over on Christmas Tree Lane just outside the stadium.
From the pregame tailgate to the final whistle, the 3252 Independent Supporters Union of LAFC sea of black and gold were on their feet, chanting for LAFC throughout the club’s 90-minute-plus run to a 4-0 victory.
“We’re passionate, not only about the team’s success on the field, but the club culture and community,” says Eddie Amuwa, a member of the Black Army 1850 supporter group within the 3252. “Whether we’re winning or losing, we’re always loud. We always give our energy and our passion. We’re all just fans that have decided to give extra of ourselves because this club represents us. What you see in the 3252 is what you see in Los Angeles: different cultures, different ideals, and different ways of life.”
From coast to coast, this is what MLS fandom looks like. Whether it’s Atlanta United FC and its Faction supporter group joining a crowd of 32,000 fans to watch as a 6-foot-tall golden spike is hammered through a makeshift railroad platform just before kickoff, or the Timbers Army cheering as Timber Joey slices his chainsaw through a log after every home goal, or the resurgence of a soccer city with St. Louis City SC christening the newly minted CITYPARK stadium, a rapidly growing legion of fans across North America are putting their club — and community — pride on display.
“That really has been the story of Major League Soccer — the incredible growth in all areas, including fan culture,” says Seth Bacon, MLS’s executive vice president of media. “One of the things that we’re proudest of is providing the opportunity for a passionate soccer fan culture that has helped us become a soccer nation.”
This season, with the introduction of MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app, fans can now feel that same stadium energy at home every week as they follow the league’s 29 clubs right from their couch. And for the first time in MLS history, each club has their own platform to produce deep, rich pre- and postgame programming in dedicated club rooms on MLS Season Pass.
“Like many sports, soccer is tribal, and people are devoutly passionate about their local club or the club where they grew up,” Bacon continues. “And in the past, there wasn’t really ever this type of platform or partner where compelling feature content and highlights would be available in this type of way. So there are a lot of really smart people behind the scenes who’ve been given the opportunity to create amazing content that’s specific to each of their clubs.”
Gone are the days of broadcast blackouts and unpredictable start times and match days. MLS Season Pass was created by Apple and MLS to help create a consistent experience for fans to watch their favorite clubs. The new service brings high-quality 1080p video, camera angles that place viewers right in the middle of the action, pre- and postgame coverage for every match, and theMLS 360whip-around show bringing the best highlights from match day across the league to fans every week.
“We have a team of people who genuinely love soccer and are passionate about growing the game globally,” says Kaylyn Kyle, cohost ofMLS 360. “There has never been a whip-around show likeMLS 360; you can literally tune into 14 games at a time and get all the goals and all the action. And the fans have been the best part: They’re sharing their feedback and helping us improve the show every week. It’s quick and informative — less ‘talk show’ and more ‘let’s get to the action’ — which makes it a lot of fun for the fans and for us.”
Viewers can also opt to listen to their home team radio for broadcast audio, and toggle between English-, Spanish-, and — for Canadian matches — French-language broadcasts all within MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app.
“The presentation is just so different than what we’ve seen in the past,” adds Bacon. “It’s an amazing step in the right direction of replicating the look and feel of what you see in a stadium, and we’ve got the best-in-class people focused on making this a great experience for our fans.”
Broadcasters Max Bretos and Brian Dunseth have been calling MLS matches for decades, and the pair are excited to see how MLS Season Pass moves the league forward on a global level, especially in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted jointly by the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
“We’ve always had to fight for relevancy,” says Dunseth. “We had to fight the narrative of ‘Hey, it’s just soccer.’ It feels like now we’re almost in the space where we’re operating on our own level — where people are starting to pay attention, and it’s not just the quality of feeling like you’re on the field; it’s the overarching quality of the whole experience.”
From the seasoned broadcasters up in the booth, to the camera operators and technical crew working their magic on and off the field, Apple went behind the scenes with the MLS Season Pass production team as LAFC faced off against the New England Revolution at home.
After a nonstop, heart-pumping 96 minutes that saw LAFC land a fourth goal, the clubs said farewell as LAFC celebrated and the stadium roars continued. For fans in attendance as well as those at home, the stadium’s energy was electrifying. And on MLS Season Pass, viewers were rewarded with one final postgame ritual: LAFC midfielder Timothy Tillman riling up the 3252 in a call-and-response chant to signal their victory. For the producers broadcasting the match, that’s what it’s all about: creating an experience that elicits a response.

2023-04-05,Decrease,Apple and global suppliers expand renewable energy to 13.7 gigawatts,"Text of this article
April 5, 2023
UPDATE
Apple and global suppliers expand renewable energy to 13.7 gigawatts
Over 250 global manufacturing partners are now on a path to decarbonize Apple production by 2030
Apple today announced its manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable electricity around the world, a nearly 30 percent increase in the last year. In total, more than 250 suppliers operating across 28 countries are committed to using renewable energy for all Apple production by 2030. This represents more than 85 percent of the company’s direct manufacturing spend and more than 20 gigawatts in commitments.
Already carbon neutral for its global corporate emissions, Apple uses innovative tools to support progress toward its ambitious 2030 goal to be carbon neutral for every product. This includes $4.7 billion in Green Bonds, which are helping finance the expansion of clean energy solutions and emissions reductions around the world. Apple today shared details of its Green Bond spend for 2022, which includes investments in large-scale solar, low-carbon design, energy efficiency, and carbon removal.
“At Apple, we’re carbon neutral for our own operations and innovating every day to go even further in the urgent work to address climate change,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “With partners around the world, we’re adding even more renewable energy to power our global supply chain and investing in next-generation green technologies. The scale of this challenge is immense — but so is our determination to meet it.”
Clean Energy Expansion Across Apple’s Supply Chain
More than 40 manufacturing partners joined Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program in the last year. Apple has called on its suppliers to decarbonize all Apple-related operations, including sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity. To help them meet their commitments and go even further, Apple works closely with suppliers to identify and implement solutions for clean energy and carbon reductions — offering a suite of free learning resources and live trainings through its Clean Energy Academy.
“Our new supplier commitments demonstrate the rapid pace of progress we’re making toward our 2030 carbon neutrality goal,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We are taking urgent action on a global scale to unlock a greener, more innovative, and more resilient future.”
Through their participation in the Supplier Clean Energy Program, Apple’s suppliers are signaling demand for the expansion of renewable electricity capacity around the world. Since 2019, the operational renewable energy across Apple’s global supply chain has expanded five times over, now totaling 13.7 gigawatts. This equated to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions last year — the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road.
Apple also supports about 1.5 gigawatts of renewable electricity around the world to power all corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores, spanning 44 countries. The company has also invested directly in nearly 500 megawatts of solar and wind in China and Japan to address upstream supply chain emissions.
Apple Suppliers Advance Clean Energy Progress Around the World
Apple’s U.S.-based manufacturing partners are making steady progress toward renewable energy, with 27 suppliers in the Supplier Clean Energy Program finding success with a variety of approaches. Some suppliers — including Bemis Associates — have achieved 100 percent renewable electricity for all Apple-related production, Coherent Corp. is nearing that goal through the use of a green utility program, while others — including Qorvo — are using power purchase agreements (PPAs) for solar and wind projects across the country.
Nearly 70 suppliers in China are now committed to 100 percent renewable electricity. Building on experiences with Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, Avary Holding, which joined the program in 2020, is launching its own initiative to help drive scalable action by having its suppliers adopt renewable energy and decarbonize. Proceeds from the 2019 Green Bond contributed to Apple’s investment in the China Clean Energy Fund, a first-of-its-kind investment fund to connect suppliers in China with renewable energy sources. The innovative approach has so far enabled Apple and its suppliers to jointly invest in over 650 megawatts of renewable electricity.
Thirty European manufacturing partners are committed to clean energy, with six — including Viscom AG and Victrex — already achieving 100 percent renewable electricity for their Apple loads. Bosch Sensortec GmbH, which recently joined Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, and VARTA Microbattery GmbH are achieving 100 percent renewable electricity through green utility power.
In Japan, 34 manufacturing partners have committed to procure 100 percent renewable energy for their Apple production. Businesses like Taiyo Holdings Co., Ltd. are deploying onsite solar solutions, and other companies are using PPAs as availability increases. This includes Rohm Company Limited and Nissha Co., Ltd., which both joined the Supplier Clean Energy Program this year. Apple and its partners also continue to work together in support of wider deployment of affordable clean energy through collaborations such as the Japan Climate Leaders’ Partnership.
Similarly, in South Korea, Apple continues to call for an ambitious 2030 national renewable energy target, and engage in collaborative advocacy to improve transparency and expand cost-effective options, especially PPAs. In total, 18 businesses headquartered in South Korea are now part of the Supplier Clean Energy Program, with LG Innotek using onsite solar to help meet its commitments and SK hynix having achieved 100 percent renewable energy for its Apple production in the country.
$4.7 Billion in Green Bonds Accelerate Environmental Progress
To help accelerate clean energy progress and environmental innovations around the world, Apple has disbursed over $3.2 billion of the company’s $4.7 billion Green Bond commitment to date — including the total $2.5 billion of its first two bonds. So far, the company has allocated $700 million of the proceeds from the 2019 Green Bond to support 59 projects — including the development and distribution of clean energy training resources for suppliers and collaborative advocacy efforts in Japan, Vietnam, and South Korea.
The projects supported by the 2019 Green Bond are expected to mitigate more than 13.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over their lifetime. Beyond building capacity for renewable energy across the supply chain, Apple’s Green Bond investments last year supported a wide range of environmental innovation across the business, including low-carbon design, energy efficiency, and the expansion of renewable energy in grids around the world.
For example, the 2019 Green Bond helped fund the IP Radian Solar project that recently became operational in Brown County, Texas, with a project that now produces 320 megawatts of electricity. Apple invested in the project to help address the carbon impact of the energy Apple customers use to charge their devices. The bond also supported the company’s utility-scale battery located at the California Flats Solar Project in Monterey County, California, which became operational in 2022. The large battery stores up to 240 megawatt-hours of renewable electricity for later use, when the carbon intensity of the grid is highest. This helps to address the intermittency of renewable power across the state.

This year’s annual impact report covers the cumulative allocation of Apple’s 2019 Green Bond proceeds to environmental projects that incurred spend between September 29, 2019, and September 24, 2022 — Apple’s 2022, 2021, and 2020 fiscal years. Sustainalytics provided a second-party opinion on the selected projects, and Ernst & Young LLP provided an attestation report on the spend.

UPDATE
Apple expands innovative Restore Fund for carbon removal
A new fund with Climate Asset Management adds another option for securing high-impact, scalable, nature-based carbon removal offsets
Apple today announced a major expansion of its Restore Fund, doubling the company’s total commitment to advancing high-quality, nature-based carbon removal projects.First launched in 2021with an up to $200 million commitment with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, the Restore Fund is now set to grow with an additional fund, including new investment from Apple, and a new portfolio of carbon removal projects. Apple created the Restore Fund to encourage global investment to protect and restore critical ecosystems and scale natural carbon removal solutions. This approach also helps address residual emissions businesses cannot yet avoid or reduce with existing technology.
As part of the expansion, Apple will invest up to an additional $200 million in the new fund, which Climate Asset Management — a joint venture of HSBC Asset Management and Pollination — will manage. The new portfolio also aims to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year at its peak while generating a financial return for investors. For Apple suppliers that become partners in the fund, it will also offer a new way for them to incorporate high-impact carbon removal projects as they decarbonize.
“The Restore Fund is an innovative investment approach that generates real, measurable benefits for the planet, while aiming to generate a financial return,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “The path to a carbon neutral economy requires deep decarbonization paired with responsible carbon removal, and innovation like this can help accelerate the pace of progress.”
Apple and Climate Asset Management are taking a broadened approach with prospective projects, pooling two distinct types of investments: nature-forward agricultural projects that generate income from sustainably managed farming practices and projects that conserve and restore critical ecosystems that remove and store carbon from the atmosphere. This unique blended fund structure aims to achieve both financial and climate benefits for investors while advancing a new model for carbon removal that more fully addresses the global potential for nature-based solutions. All Restore Fund investments are subject to rigorous social and environmental standards.
Already carbon neutral for its corporate operations, last year Applecalled onits suppliers to become carbon neutral across all Apple-related operations by 2030, including all of their direct and electricity-related emissions, also known as Scope 1 and Scope 2. High-quality carbon removals will help achieve this goal by offsetting any direct emissions that cannot be avoided or reduced. Suppliers are first expected to reduce emissions by transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and abating direct emissions. Earlier this month, Apple announced over 250 manufacturing partners have committed to power their Apple production with 100 percent renewable energy by 2030.
Located in Brazil and Paraguay, Apple’s three initial investments with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs aim to restore 150,000 acres of sustainably certified working forests and protect an additional 100,000 acres of native forests, grasslands, and wetlands. Together, these projects are forecast to remove 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year by 2025. Carbon removal is critical to addressing climate change and achieving global climate goals, as leading scientific bodies like the IPCC have emphasized.
To accurately monitor and measure the impact of Restore Fund projects, Apple is deploying innovative remote sensing technologies — including Space Intelligence’s Carbon and Habitat Mapper, Upstream Tech’s Lens platform, and high-resolution satellite imagery from Maxar — to construct habitat and forest carbon maps of the project areas. These detailed maps will help ensure that projects meet our high standards prior to investment and will quantify and verify the projects’ carbon removal impact over time. Apple is also further exploring the use of the LiDAR Scanner on iPhone to enhance monitoring capabilities on the ground.
The Restore Fund is part of the company’s comprehensive roadmap to become carbon neutral for its entire supply chain and life cycle of every product by 2030. Apple will reduce 75 percent of all emissions by 2030 and balance the remaining emissions with high-quality carbon removal.

2023-04-13,Increase,Apple will use 100 percent recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025,"Text of this article
April 13, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple will use 100 percent recycled cobalt in batteries by 2025
Industry-leading innovation paves new path for key recycled metals in batteries, magnets, and circuit boards
Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today announced a major acceleration of its work to expand recycled materials across its products, including a new 2025 target to use 100 percent recycled cobalt1in all Apple-designed batteries. Additionally, by 2025, magnets in Apple devices will use entirely recycled rare earth elements, and all Apple-designed printed circuit boards will use 100 percent recycled tin soldering and 100 percent recycled gold plating.
In 2022, the company significantly expanded its use of key recycled metals, and now sources over two-thirds of all aluminum, nearly three-quarters of all rare earths, and more than 95 percent of all tungsten in Apple products from 100 percent recycled material. This rapid progress brings Apple closer to its aim to one day make all products with only recycled and renewable materials, and advances the company’s 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral.
“Every day, Apple is innovating to make technology that enriches people’s lives, while protecting the planet we all share,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “From the recycled materials in our products, to the clean energy that powers our operations, our environmental work is integral to everything we make and to who we are. So we’ll keep pressing forward in the belief that great technology should be great for our users, and for the environment.”
“Our ambition to one day use 100 percent recycled and renewable materials in our products works hand in hand with Apple 2030: our goal to achieve carbon neutral products by 2030,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’re working toward both goals with urgency and advancing innovation across our entire industry in the process.”
Charting Progress to 2025
Apple has significantly expanded the use of100 percent certified recycled cobaltover the past three years, making it possible to include in all Apple-designed batteries by 2025. In 2022, a quarter of all cobalt found in Apple products came from recycled material, up from 13 percent the previous year. Cobalt is a critical material in the batteries used in most consumer electronics, including Apple devices, enabling high energy density while also meeting Apple’s robust standards for longevity and safety. Apple-designed batteries found in iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook, and many other products represent a significant majority of the company’s use of cobalt.
The company’s use of100 percent certified recycled rare earth elementshas greatly expanded in the last year as well, going from 45 percent in 2021 to 73 percent in 2022. Since first introducing recycled rare earths in the Taptic Engine of iPhone 11, Apple has expanded its use of the material across its devices, including in all magnets found in the latest iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, MacBook, and Mac models. As magnets are by far Apple’s largest use of rare earths, the new 2025 target means nearly all rare earths in Apple products will soon be 100 percent recycled.
As part of the accelerated new timeline, all Apple-designed printed circuit boards will use100 percent certified recycled gold platingby 2025. This includes rigid boards, such as the main logic board, and flexible boards, like those connecting to the cameras or buttons in iPhone. Since pioneering an exclusively recycled supply chain for gold in the plating of the main logic board for iPhone 13, Apple has extended the material’s use in additional components and products, including the wire of all cameras in the iPhone 14 lineup, and printed circuit boards of iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods Pro, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and HomePod. Apple is also working to encourage broader adoption of recycled gold for non-custom components across the electronics industry.
By 2025, the company will use100 percent certified recycled tinsolderingon all Apple-designed printed rigid and flexible circuit boards. In recent years, Apple’s use of recycled tin has expanded to the solder of many flexible printed circuit boards across Apple products, with 38 percent of all tin used last year coming from recycled sources. The application of recycled tin across even more components is underway, and the company is engaging more suppliers in this effort.
Innovation has also driven progress toward another of Apple’s 2025 commitments: toeliminate plastics from the company’s packaging. The development of fiber alternatives for packaging components like screen films, wraps, and foam cushioning has kept Apple on track toward this ambitious goal. To address the remaining 4 percent plastic in the company’s packaging footprint, Apple is innovating to replace labels, lamination, and other small uses. In the last year, Apple developed a custom printer to introduce digital printing directly onto the boxes of iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro, eliminating the need for most labels. And a new overprint varnish found in iPad Air, iPad Pro, and Apple Watch Series 8 packaging replaces the polypropylene plastic lamination found on boxes and packaging components. The innovation helped avoid over 1,100 metric tons of plastic and over 2,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide.
Progress in Responsible Sourcing of Primary and Recycled Materials
As Apple reduces its reliance on newly mined minerals, it is also pursuing ways to directly support communities whose livelihoods depend on mining. The company is partnering with experts such as the Fund for Global Human Rights to provide support for frontline human rights and environmental defenders, including in the African Great Lakes region, as well as vocational education programs that enable members of local communities moving away from mining to build skills and pursue new opportunities.
Apple sources primary minerals responsibly and drives the highest level of human rights and environmental standards across its supply chain. Apple was the first electronics company to publish a list of cobalt and lithium refiners in its battery supply chain, with cobalt in 2016 and lithium in 2020. In 2017, the company mapped its supply chain for rare earths. And since 2015, every identified smelter and refiner for tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold has participated in independent third-party audits.
In the transition to recycled and renewable content, Apple has prioritized 14 materials based on environment, human rights, and supply impact that together account for nearly 90 percent of the material shipped in Apple products: aluminum, cobalt, copper, glass, gold, lithium, paper, plastics, rare earth elements, steel, tantalum, tin, tungsten, and zinc.
In 2022, about 20 percent of all material shipped in Apple products came from recycled or renewable sources. This includes the first use of recycled copper foil in the main logic board of iPad (10th generation), the introduction of certified recycled steel in the battery tray of MacBook Air with the M2 chip, 100 percent recycled tungsten in the latest Apple Watch lineup, and the aluminum enclosures found in many Apple products, made with a 100 percent recycled aluminum alloy designed by Apple.
Innovating for the Future of Recycling
Apple’s work to pioneer new research and development for end-of-life disassembly and recycling has helped make this progress possible. Through extensive efforts including partnerships with leading research institutions and the Material Recovery Lab in Austin, Texas, Apple engineers and experts are developing innovative ways to give materials in Apple products new life, and helping inform design decisions that support disassembly and recovery.
The company’s iPhone disassembly robot, Daisy, separates batteries from other components, and enables specialty recyclers to recover cobalt and other materials, including lithium. Since 2019, Apple estimates that more than 11,000 kilograms of cobalt have been recovered from batteries extracted by Daisy and then returned to the secondary market. Daisy also helps recover rare earth elements, which are largely lost through traditional electronics recycling processes.
Daisy is just one example of how Apple’s innovations in recycling and disassembly can drive industrywide change. The company’s Dave robot, now deployed with a recycling partner in China, can help further accelerate recovery of rare earth elements by disassembling Taptic Engines.
Apple has also begun deploying overhead projector-based augmented reality (AR) systems to recycling partners. The system guides the disassembly of devices including MacBook and iPad by projecting video imagery directly onto a work surface. The company publishes Apple Recycler Guides for global recyclers to maximize efficiency of material recovery while safeguarding human health and safety. As recycled and renewable materials can contribute to lowering each product’s carbon footprint, enhanced recovery is also bringing Apple closer to its ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire supply chain and the life cycle of every product by 2030.

UPDATE
Apple announces major progress toward climate goals ahead of Earth Day
Customers are invited to celebrate by learning more about climate change and taking action with Apple
Ahead of Earth Day, Apple is announcing progress toward its ambitious goal to make every product carbon neutral by 2030, including a new framework for sharing the reduced climate impact of new models of iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air, and Apple Watch. The company is also announcing new partnerships for innovating climate solutions and engaging communities, and inviting customers to learn and take action with new curated collections and tailored activities across Apple platforms.
Already carbon neutral for its global corporate operations, Apple has decreased its comprehensive carbon footprint by over 45 percent since 2015, even as the company’s revenue has grown by over 68 percent during that same period. In total last year, the company’s extensive environmental efforts — including expanding renewable energy across its global supply chain, and building products with recycled and other low-carbon materials — avoided more than 28 million metric tons of carbon.
“We are closer than ever to achieving our vision of Apple 2030 — our ambitious goal to make every product carbon neutral by 2030 — and we are thrilled to celebrate the tremendous progress with our customers this Earth Day,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our customers can use their Apple devices knowing they are made with the environment in mind — that means more clean energy, more industry-leading durability, even greater efficiency, and more recycled and low-carbon materials than ever before.”
Detailing this progress, the2023 Environmental Progress Reportreleased today highlights the company’s continued work with recycling innovation, stewardship of natural resources, and clean energy initiatives. Additionally, Apple released its annualPeople and Environment in Our Supply Chain Report.
Apple 2030: Proof in the Products
Today, Apple released a new framework to share how its environmental efforts around renewable energy, efficiency, and materials innovation are already significantly reducing the climate impact of Apple products. To showcase this progress clearly for customers, Apple also released updatedProduct Environment Reportsfor iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, iPad (10th generation), MacBook Air with the M2 chip, and Apple Watch Series 8.
The company conducted in-depth analyses to determine the percentage of manufacturing powered by clean energy for each of these products and how the expanded use of recycled materials is lowering each device’s climate impact. For example, Apple has reduced the emissions of MacBook Air with M2 by 38 percent. This significant reduction was largely driven by the use of 40 percent total recycled and renewable content in the device. For Apple Watch Series 8, the company’s actions — including the use of 40 percent renewable electricity for manufacturing — have reduced the device’s climate impact by 26 percent.
Apple plans to share this detailed level of progress in future Product Environment Reports, building on the company’s long-standing commitment to transparency, and inviting customers to follow along on the journey to carbon neutral products.
Partnering to Innovate Solutions and Engage Communities Around the World
As Apple accelerates progress toward its 2030 goal, the company remains committed to prioritizing communities disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change and partnering with organizations innovating for the future. Today, Apple announced new partnerships and support for global efforts to engage communities in environmental solutions, including work aligned with Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative.
In Latin America, Apple will work with Conservation International to support leadership in Afro-descendant communities with economic opportunities that deliver outcomes for addressing the climate and biodiversity crises. In addition, the partnership will support the Afro-InterAmerican Forum on Climate Change (AIFCC) — a first-of-its-kind collective effort to elevate the perspectives and experiences of Afro-descendant populations in addressing and mitigating climate change in the Americas.
In partnership with the Society of Entrepreneurs and Ecology Foundation, Apple is supporting the development of a certified methodology for blue carbon in China. Blue carbon refers to the carbon dioxide pulled from the atmosphere and stored deep within oceans and coastal ecosystems, including mangrove forests. Apple supports blue carbon projects in Colombia and India that serve as a model for creating alternative, sustainable economies around the preservation of mangroves. The partnership in China will build on that work, offering new ways for local communities to participate in the conservation and restoration of mangrove ecosystems.
Apple is also partnering with World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on a new initiative called the Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) Origination Platform, which aims to showcase a new model of scaling up, aligning, and mobilizing public and private investments for high-quality nature-based solutions under an integrated landscape approach. Under the platform, WWF will leverage its global reach and partnerships, and the momentum behind climate and nature commitments, to showcase interventions in priority landscapes that address systemic threats, and generate impacts for climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development.
In the U.S., Apple has partnered with Beyond Benign to bring green chemistry and sustainable science programming to minority-serving institutions across the country, and expand the talent pool of Black, Hispanic, and Native American scientists trained in sustainability for global high-value companies. Apple is also supporting local organizations promoting environmental justice for their communities, including City Blossoms in Washington, D.C.; Environmental Health Coalition in California and Tijuana, Mexico; and Little Village Environmental Justice Organization in Chicago.
Celebrate and Take Action with Apple
In celebration of Earth Day, Apple is offering a series of ways to help customers learn about and connect with the environment, and take action to reduce their impact on the planet.
One easy way customers can help the planet — on Earth Day or any day — is by bringing their old devices back to Apple. The company offers trade-in services and free recycling that make it easy to recycle devices, divert electronic waste from landfills, and save precious materials in the quest to take less from the earth. This Earth Day, Apple is introducing anew Apple Trade In landing pagefor customers in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada that estimates the value of a trade-in device to help users get started on their recycling journey and help give their products new life.
Apple is also encouraging customers to visit an Apple Store location and get involved through exclusiveToday at Appleprogramming. Global sessions include an activity where kids can create one-of-a-kind comics inspired by planet Earth on iPad with Apple Pencil, blending creativity and education, and some locations will also include programming that explores the power of recycled plastic. Select stores will host powerful conversations, art, and poetry curated by Indigenous artist Tomás Karmelo Amaya and the Native Wellness Institute’s Shalene Joseph.
On the App Store, users can learn how to take actionable steps to protect the planet, starting with their closets. An Earth Day collection titled “How It’s Easy to Be Stylish and Sustainable” features apps such aseBay,Good On You, andDrest, which champion secondhand shopping experiences, boost ethical and sustainable fashion, and promote cyclical shopping behaviors through virtual wardrobes and experiences.
Apple TV+ celebrates Earth Day with a slate of new and award-winning programming for the whole family, including the mission-driven seriesJane, inspired by the work of legendary conservationist Dr. Jane Goodall; nature docuseriesBig Beasts, narrated by Tom Hiddleston; and a family-friendlySago Mini Friendsspecial. Subscribers can also enjoy favorites that illuminate the spectacular wonders of the planet, and the importance of protecting it, withPrehistoric Planet,Earth at Night in Color,The Elephant Queen,Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth,Tiny World,The Year Earth Changed, and more.
Additionally, on the Apple TV app, viewers can explore a range of collections inspired by the mantra “The Future Is Up to Us.” The three main focus areas — reduce and reuse, rethink, and reconnect — will showcase individuals and communities who are committed to fighting climate change through innovative, everyday actions. This space will also feature guest curation by Scott Z. Burns, creator of the Apple Original seriesExtrapolations, who highlights some of his favorite environmental films and cinematic recommendations for any day, not just Earth Day.
In a special episode ofApple News In Conversation,host Shumita Basu spoke with Burns and actor Sienna Miller about the Hollywood star power that came together to makeExtrapolations, and what it will take to make real progress in the fight against climate change. Apple News will also feature a special curated collection that celebrates natural wonders; explores climate science, service, and solutions; and highlights the remarkable people and communities fighting for a greener world.

Apple empowers small businesses to grow and serve their customers
The founders of Kids of Immigrants, Señor Sisig, and Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo share how they’ve harnessed the Apple ecosystem to grow their companies over the years
From the inception of an inventive business idea through the planning stages, grand opening, and subsequent growth and expansion, small business entrepreneurs are harnessing the power of Apple hardware, software, and services every day to manage their operations and connect directly with customers.
In Los Angeles, streetwear brand Kids of Immigrants uses iPad and Apple Pencil to bring its colorful pieces to life, and Mac to bring them to the world. In the San Francisco Bay Area, Señor Sisig, originally a small food truck business powered by iPad, has expanded into a local Filipino street food phenom usingApple Business Essentialsand a fleet of Apple devices. And in the Philadelphia suburbs, Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo usesTap to Pay on iPhoneto speed up its checkout process and keep customers happy, andApple Business Connectto manage its presence across the Apple ecosystem.
Below, learn more about the spark that led the founders of each business down the path to entrepreneurship, the Apple products and services they’ve used to expand their operations, and the milestones that have shaped them into the thriving small businesses they are today.
Vibrant Designs Spring to Life with iPad and Apple Pencil
Living in Pico-Union in the heart of Los Angeles turned out to be the impetus Daniel Buezo and Weleh Dennis needed to bring Kids of Immigrants to life. The pair had been ruminating for several years on a creative project that would honor immigrant families’ roots — Dennis’s parents hail from Liberia, while Buezo’s are from Honduras — and they found no shortage of inspiration in the vibrant, bustling neighborhood, a historic nexus for the city’s immigrant communities.
“We wanted to tell our story,” Buezo explains of the streetwear brand they officially launched in 2015. “Growing up and being into style, fashion, and streetwear, we felt underrepresented and didn’t feel fully seen. With Kids of Immigrants, representation and empowerment are our values. We are going deeper into who we are and paying homage to our parents for all they did for us.”
Armed at first with just an iPhone and a friend’s MacBook Pro, Buezo and Dennis began Kids of Immigrants by reworking and upcycling vintage pieces sourced from local thrift stores, and tapping their friends to serve as the fledgling brand’s models, directors, and photographers. And from there, using Apple Pencil and iPad (10th generation), they designed and launched the line of colorful pieces with community-driven messaging they’re now known for.
“My real unlock was being able to take inspiration from my surroundings and draw or animate them with the iPad in Adobe,” says Dennis. “It gives a certain ease and flow to the creative process — it’s a game changer.”
As the company expands, its day-to-day operations are powered by Mac mini with Studio Display and MacBook Pro.
“Mac mini and Studio Display serve us phenomenally in two separate areas of our business: product and design, and logistics and fulfillment,” says Christian Gray, the company’s director of operations. “Thanks to the technology and improvements Apple is consistently making through understanding its consumers, we’re constantly finding cool shortcuts that help us be more efficient and dial everything in.”
A Mobile Business Takes Root with Apple Business Essentials
With their fleet of four food trucks and three brick-and-mortar restaurants across the San Francisco Bay Area, Evan Kidera and Gil Payumo are on a quest: bringing sisig — a tangy street food staple in the Philippines made of minced pork — to the masses in the form of burritos, tacos, nachos, and fries.
The pair launched their business, Señor Sisig, out of a single truck in 2010. “At the time, we really felt that sisig could be the iconic dish of the Philippines that spreads around the world,” Kidera says. “But we had to start off putting it in something people would feel comfortable with and not intimidated by. The hope is that sisig is just like the California roll or the burrito, where it cracks the seal for everything.”
The masses came forth and devoured, and the business grew from there. “Being a food truck was pretty hard when we started out,” Kidera explains. “There wasn’t much out there to support mobile businesses, aside from iPhone. And then the original iPad came right after that. I think iPad was really the thing that allowed us to grow as a mobile business; the timing of it was just great, because we were able to take payments on the go without having to rely only on cash.”
Señor Sisig’s employees use Apple devices to keep track of inventory, monitor sales, and communicate between stores, and recently adopted Apple Business Essentials to solve its growing IT needs. Launched last year, the service seamlessly brings together device management, 24/7 Apple Support, and iCloud storage into one subscription for small businesses.
“We’ve been lucky enough to have some really good relationships with Apple business partners at different stores over the years,” Kidera says. “It feels more like a partnership than us just going into a store. We have a direct person we can talk about the new technology with as it comes out. To have somebody we can go to and talk about firsthand experience with is key, and also to have somebody who’s going to tell us about things we’re not seeing.”
The team is also using Apple Business Connect — a free tool that allows businesses of all sizes to customize the way their information appears across Apple apps — to keep customers up-to-date on its various locations.
“The goal is to ensure that people know they can use our place cards in Apple Maps not only as a way to get to our business through navigation, but also to order their food and complete their payment right from the Maps app,” says Kidera — important as the company eyes further expansion outside of the Bay Area, California, and even the country.
Customers Come First with Tap to Pay on iPhone
On a typical weekend afternoon, the massive 3,500-square-foot storefront that Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo now calls home reverberates with energy and warmth as customers peruse the store’s aisles in search of the perfect look for their big day.
But the business began much more modestly back in 2013, when married couple Franco Salerno and Wendy Ianieri-Salerno hatched a plan on the back of a napkin on the way home from a wedding in Mexico. At the time, local options for formalwear were limited in their hometown, a suburb north of Philadelphia.
“Three months later, we opened our store with bridal gowns, tuxedos, suits, prom dresses, and bridesmaids’ dresses,” Salerno says. Within six months, the pair were doing so much business they had outgrown their original storefront. They expanded their staff, which now includes daughters Daria and Deanna, and focused on providing the kind of bespoke service that has kept customers coming back for all their formalwear needs.
Having the right technology in place was key as operations expanded. Employee scheduling requests are now sent and approved using the Square Payroll app on iPhone, and the team uses the LiveHelpNow app for iPhone and Mac to communicate directly with customers who text the store’s landline. Salerno regularly logs into Apple Business Connect to update Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo’s place card with fresh photos, and uses the Showcase feature in Business Connect to promote upcoming events.
iPad with Square initially served as the store’s primary cash register, and today, to make the checkout process even quicker, employees can useTap to Pay on iPhonewith the Square Point of Sale app to complete sales from anywhere in the store using only an iPhone, with no additional hardware. This newfound flexibility is especially vital from mid-March through Thanksgiving, otherwise known as peak wedding season.
“During our busiest months, the store can get so crowded that there are often lines of people waiting to be served or to pay,” Salerno explains. “In the past, customers would get frustrated by the wait; some would even leave. Now with Tap to Pay on iPhone, we can walk around the store and check customers out, alleviating the probability of someone leaving before we can serve them.”
That’s a win for the customer, and a win for Darianna Bridal & Tuxedo. For entrepreneurs like Salerno, the Apple ecosystem has the power to help keep a small business up and running for years to come.
To celebrate National Small Business Week (April 30 to May 6), select Apple Store locations inNew York City,Washington, D.C., andChicagowill host Today at Apple sessions titled “Grow Your Business With Apple.” These free sessions offer small businesses expertise on how to make it easy to customize their presence across Apple apps with Apple Business Connect, accept payments with Tap to Pay on iPhone, and get support and manage devices with Apple Business Essentials. Businesses can alsosign upfor a virtual session scheduled for June 14. To learn more about Apple’s small business tools, visitapple.com/business/small-business.

2023-05-02,Decrease,Apple and Google lead initiative for an industry specification to address unwanted tracking,"Text of this article
May 2, 2023
UPDATE
Apple and Google lead initiative for an industry specification to address unwanted tracking
Companies welcome input from industry participants and advocacy groups on a draft specification to alert users in the event of suspected unwanted tracking
Location-tracking devices help users find personal items like their keys, purse, luggage, and more through crowdsourced finding networks. However, they can also be misused for unwanted tracking of individuals.
Today Apple and Google jointly submitted a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth location-tracking devices for unwanted tracking. The first-of-its-kind specification will allow Bluetooth location-tracking devices to be compatible with unauthorized tracking detection and alerts across iOS and Android platforms. Samsung, Tile, Chipolo, eufy Security, and Pebblebee have expressed support for the draft specification, which offers best practices and instructions for manufacturers, should they choose to build these capabilities into their products.
“Apple launched AirTag to give users the peace of mind knowing where to find their most important items,” said Ron Huang, Apple’s vice president of Sensing and Connectivity. “We built AirTag and the Find My network with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — and we continue to make improvements to help ensure the technology is being used as intended. This new industry specification builds upon the AirTag protections, and through collaboration with Google results in a critical step forward to help combat unwanted tracking across iOS and Android.”
“Bluetooth trackers have created tremendous user benefits, but they also bring the potential of unwanted tracking, which requires industrywide action to solve,” said Dave Burke, Google’s vice president of Engineering for Android. “Android has an unwavering commitment to protecting users, and will continue to develop strong safeguards and collaborate with the industry to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices.”
In addition to incorporating feedback from device manufacturers, input from various safety and advocacy groups has been integrated into the development of the specification.
“The National Network to End Domestic Violence has been advocating for universal standards to protect survivors — and all people — from the misuse of Bluetooth tracking devices. This collaboration and the resulting standards are a significant step forward. NNEDV is encouraged by this progress,” said Erica Olsen, the National Network to End Domestic Violence’s senior director of its Safety Net Project. “These new standards will minimize opportunities for abuse of this technology and decrease the burden on survivors in detecting unwanted trackers. We are grateful for these efforts and look forward to continuing to work together to address unwanted tracking and misuse.”
“Today’s release of a draft specification is a welcome step to confront harmful misuses of Bluetooth location trackers,” said Alexandra Reeve Givens, the Center for Democracy & Technology’s president and CEO. “CDT continues to focus on ways to make these devices more detectable and reduce the likelihood that they will be used to track people. A key element to reducing misuse is a universal, OS-level solution that is able to detect trackers made by different companies on the variety of smartphones that people use every day. We commend Apple and Google for their partnership and dedication to developing a uniform solution to improve detectability. We look forward to the specification moving through the standardization process and to further engagement on ways to reduce the risk of Bluetooth location trackers being misused.”
Thespecificationhas been submitted as an Internet-Draft via theInternet Engineering Task Force(IETF), a leading standards development organization. Interested parties are invited and encouraged to review and comment over the next three months. Following the comment period, Apple and Google will partner to address feedback, and will release a production implementation of the specification for unwanted tracking alerts by the end of 2023 that will then be supported in future versions of iOS and Android.

2023-05-08,Increase,A California school district brings creativity to life with Apple Learning Coach,"Apple Learning Coach gave us the tools to be able to meet educators where they are, no matter the level of their technology knowledge.
Jennifer Robbins, Downey Unified director of elementary education
Text of this article
May 8, 2023
FEATURE
A California school district brings creativity to life with Apple Learning Coach
The professional learning program expands to 12 additional countries this year
Something transformative is happening in the Downey Unified School District in Southern California.
“There’s a buzz,” says Allison Box, principal at Lewis Elementary School. “It’s exciting — there’s never a boring day here, and that’s because our kids are immersed in learning environments that are truly dynamic.”
Across the district, students are using Apple technology to create projects as varied as podcasts with GarageBand, animations with Keynote, and movies with Clips — and these changes are reshaping classrooms. At the center of this transformation is a group of educators who have applied their knowledge from the Apple Learning Coach program to rethink how teachers and students approach their studies.
Apple Learning Coach is a free professional learning program that trains instructional coaches, digital learning specialists, and other coaching educators to help teachers effectively use Apple technology in the classroom. More than 1,900 educators have already completed the program in the United States, and the next cohort is nowaccepting applicationsthrough May 30. Additionally, Apple Learning Coach is expanding to 12 more countries, in addition to the United States, by the end of the year.
Downey Unified is home to 22,000 students from transitional kindergarten through grade 12 across 22 schools, including eight Apple Distinguished Schools. More than 10 years ago, the district began using iPod touch to aid with reading fluency for English language learners. Fast forward to today, and all elementary schools provide an iPad to every student and, since the pandemic, middle schools are also 1:1 with iPad.
Downey follows the coherence model, where all schools have the same access to technology, education, tools, and services. For example, each school has an Innovation Lab with coding, robotics, and green screen film projects, and Student Tech Squads provide leadership opportunities where older students mentor younger students and facilitate districtwide creativity and innovation competitions. In addition, a cornerstone at Downey is that all educators are provided professional learning opportunities — and since it launched in 2021, this includes Apple Learning Coach. To date, Downey has 15 certified Apple Learning Coaches, with an additional five educators currently enrolled in the program.
Through a mix of self-paced lessons and virtual workshops with Apple Professional Learning Specialists, each Apple Learning Coach gains a deeper understanding of how to support teachers in the classroom as they integrate technology into learning. Upon completing the program, each Apple Learning Coach comes away with an actionable coaching portfolio they can begin using immediately.
Marnie Luevano was certified as an Apple Learning Coach last year. Her role as an instructional technology coach at Downey Unified brings her into the district’s elementary schools, where she helps teachers reimagine how they use Apple technology to supercharge lessons.
“We work with teachers to identify new ways their students can demonstrate what they’ve learned beyond the use of a worksheet or simply writing an essay,” says Luevano. “And then the kids are taking off with it — they’re so excited. Every time we visit the schools, the kids can’t wait to tell us about the podcast they’re finishing or show us the cover they designed for one of their projects. They’re not just trying to get the assignment done — they’re really enjoying the process.”
This year, as a result of the Apple Learning Coach program, the district’s coaches are deepening their use of Apple’sEveryone Can Createresources. Every week, a new Everyone Can Create project is featured and distributed to educators, and the district technology team has created a digital fluency deck to give its teachers technology goals for students based on grade level. For example, by the end of first grade, students will be able to record video using the camera on iPad, and by the end of second grade, they will be able to build on that skill to combine video with photos and audio in iMovie.
Jennifer Robbins has been working in Downey for 27 years and is the district’s director of elementary education, as well as an Apple Learning Coach. She hasn’t just seen a change in the students as their access to technology has increased — she’s also watched her fellow educators learn and grow.
“Apple Learning Coach gave us the tools to be able to meet educators where they are, no matter the level of their technology knowledge,” says Robbins. “So we want to give voice and choice to our kids, but we want the same for our teachers. We work to customize the learning for them too.”
The results for Downey have been measurable. In an era of declining enrollment across California public schools, Downey has seen growth in its student population. Principal Box, who is also an Apple Learning Coach, credits the program with helping to transform schools in the district, including her own.
“Apple has truly been a game changer in education, both for our teachers and our students,” says Box. “In applying the Apple Learning Coach model, we’re achieving a higher level of engagement, and it’s opening up so many possibilities — we’re thinking about what an augmented reality program or app design studio might look like for our school. It’s helping us create a culture that embraces change and innovation, and prepares our students for the future, and I’m very excited about what’s next.”

2023-05-09,Decrease,Apple Watch Pride Edition celebrates the LGBTQ+ community,"Text of this article
May 9, 2023
UPDATE
Apple Watch Pride Edition celebrates the LGBTQ+ community
Celebrating the ongoing movement to protect and advance equality for LGBTQ+ communities around the world, Apple is introducing a new Pride Edition Sport Band accompanied by a matching watch face and iOS wallpaper.
Through these efforts, Apple supports and brings awareness to LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations that are working to bring about positive change, including Equality Federation Institute, an advocacy accelerator that is building a network of state-based LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations in the U.S., and GLSEN, an education organization working to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Additional advocacy organizations Apple supports include Encircle, Equality North Carolina, Equality Texas, Gender Spectrum, Human Rights Campaign, ILGA World, the National Center for Transgender Equality, PFLAG, SMYAL, and The Trevor Project.
Inspired by the strength and beauty of the LGBTQ+ community, the new Sport Band design showcases the original pride flag rainbow colors and five others — black and brown symbolize Black and Latin communities, in addition to those who have passed away from or are living with HIV/AIDS, while light blue, pink, and white represent transgender and nonbinary individuals.
This year’s design integrates a joyful rainbow of geometric shapes on a white base, which are compression-molded into the final band. In the forming process, the base material flows around each individual shape, creating small variations in their layout. No two bands are exactly alike, reflecting the individuality of all members of the LGBTQ+ community.
The new Pride Celebration watch face and iOS wallpaper honor the combined strength and mutual support of the LGBTQ+ community. Colorful shapes appear to circulate into the watch display from the band, and respond when a user raises and moves their wrist or taps the display. The corresponding wallpaper is another vibrant interpretation of this year’s Pride design and dynamically moves when the user unlocks their iPhone.

Plug-in Tiles put the most useful controls at the creator’s fingertips, making it easy to quickly shape sounds. With the built-in mics on iPad, users can capture voice or instrument recordings, and with five studio-quality mics on iPad Pro, users can turn virtually any space into a recording studio. Creators can also make precision edits and draw detailed track automation with Apple Pencil, and connect a Smart Keyboard Folio or Magic Keyboard to utilize key commands that speed up production.

2023-05-11,Decrease,Small developers on the App Store grew revenue by 71 percent over the past two years,"Text of this article
May 11, 2023
UPDATE
Small developers on the App Store grew revenue by 71 percent over the past two years
An independent study found resilience in small developers, whose growth outpaces large developers
Anindependent studyconducted by economists at Analysis Group found that small developers on the App Store grew their businesses and reached more customers around the world, even outpacing larger developers. With the support of a wide range of App Store tools and initiatives, small developers globally — defined as those earning up to $1 million a year and with fewer than 1 million annual downloads — grew revenue 71 percent between 2020 and 2022. In the U.S., those developers saw an above-average increase of 87 percent in earnings during the same period.
Entrepreneurs Find New Possibilities and Global Growth
In a new study titled “Small Business Developers and App Creators on the App Store in 2022,” Analysis Group economists found that revenue growth for small developers active on the storefront since 2020 exceeded that of large developers as these entrepreneurs identified new ways to tap into the needs of their users. Small developers — who comprise more than 90 percent of all developers on the App Store — saw earnings increase across all app categories; health and fitness, sports, and lifestyle apps from small developers in particular more than doubled their earnings in the last two years.
Developers of all sizes have built successful businesses while benefiting from the App Store’s global reach in 175 countries and over 40 languages, and Apple’s installed base of over 2 billion active devices around the world. In 2022, nearly 80 percent of small developers were active on multiple storefronts and about 40 percent of total app downloads from all small developers came from users outside of each developer’s home country. Additionally, the economists found that developers who monetize their apps by selling digital goods and services on multiple storefronts have earnings from users on more than 40 storefronts on average.
The research also found the App Store has helped developers grow beyond small teams to scale their businesses to establish a worldwide reach. Many developers who sold digital goods and services on the App Store and earned more than $1 million in 2022 were previously small developers. Of these global developers, 40 percent were either not on the App Store or had less than $10,000 in earnings just five years ago.
Analysis Group economists also found that thousands of new developers and entrepreneurs joined the App Store in 2022 from all over the world. Of this set of new developers, approximately 25 percent came from Europe, 23 percent from China, 14 percent from the U.S., 4 percent from Japan, and 35 percent from other regions including South Korea, India, and Brazil.
Small Businesses Shine on the App Store
Mindful Mamas, an all-encompassing mental wellness app, is helping mothers and parents address the unique challenges of motherhood. Since 2020, the app has helped mothers find time for themselves and was cofounded by licensed psychologist Terra LaRock, who faced her own harrowing postpartum experience. As conversations around mental health became more transparent, LaRock saw an opportunity to provide easily accessible tools to support moms through evidence-based guided meditation, sleep stories, and lessons that help users reduce anxiety and stress.
As a small team of four, Mindful Mamas has relied on a variety of resources to help further its mission, including Apple’s Small Business Program. The team has been able to build out new features and expand strategic relationships with healthcare providers who leverage the app as a part of their services.
“Having more revenue available has given our business a longer runway to invest in more feature development and deliver personalized experiences to moms,” says LaRock, Mindful Mamas’ CEO. In the last year, this has included new in-app events and the introduction of a mood tracker that delivers more customized insights to “mamas,” as the app endearingly calls its users.
“This program has also allowed us to begin developing more of the great features offered by Apple, like a daily encouragement widget, currently in development and planned for release this summer,” says Jillian Lee Stout, Mindful Mamas’ cofounder and chief product and technology officer.
Today, Mindful Mamas has over 20,000 moms turning to the app for support every month. Moms most active in the app are using it twice per day, and 86 percent of them report feeling better or much better after completing a single practice. Mindful Mamas is focused on expanding its current offering of programs for children, and delivering more content for all moms and parents as their needs evolve.
Launched in 2018, landscape design appiScapehelps users easily visualize outdoor projects from start to finish. With more than a decade of experience as a landscape contractor, CEO and founder Patrick Pozzuto created the augmented reality app to put inspiration back into the hands of homeowners and professionals.
“I had this feeling that things could be successful, and that technology would be a powerful solution to help users save time and see a finished project before things even begin,” Pozzuto explains.
Taking his idea from inception to reality, Pozzuto developed iScape, which leverages ARKit and SpriteKit to add in 2D and 3D models to a user’s surroundings, helping them visualize, design, and plan out what is needed for an outdoor living project.
“As a founder, you have to stay at it with the latest and greatest technologies, and Apple has helped me do this. Even with the growth we naturally experienced during the pandemic, as people had more time to invest in home projects, we have continued to benefit year after year from our investment in industry-leading technologies,” he says.
With over 2.5 million downloads already, iScape has seen triple-digit percent growth year over year. With a talented team supporting the app, iScape has a bright future ahead as professionals, retailers, and homeowners alike turn to the app for its technical capabilities and its ability to save users time, money, and effort.
Developer Resources Are Growing
Developers of all sizes have built successful businesses while benefiting from the App Store’s global reach. Apple provides a number of initiatives to support small developers on the App Store, including the App Store Small Business Program, Apple Entrepreneur Camp, App Accelerators, and Apple Developer Academies. Additionally, ongoing informational series like App Store Sessions, Ask Apple, and Tech Talks offer developers even more opportunities to connect directly with Apple experts year-round for insight, support, and feedback on the latest features and technologies available.
An extensive suite of free tools and frameworks — including software development kits (SDKs) and developer services with more than 250,000 APIs — support developers building apps for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. These tools enable developers to add new functionalities to their apps easily and quickly, and harness powerful capabilities like machine learning, augmented reality, and many more. The Swift Student Challenge, as well as open access tools like Everyone Can Code and Swift Playgrounds, ensure the power of coding technology is accessible and inclusive.

2023-05-16,Increase,App Store stopped more than $2 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2022,"Text of this article
May 16, 2023
UPDATE
App Store stopped more than $2 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2022
The App Store launched in 2008 with the mission of accomplishing two important objectives: to establish a reliable and secure platform for users to safely discover and download apps, and to provide developers with an exciting opportunity to showcase their ideas and grow their business.
Over the years, Apple has introduced various measures to support an ecosystem that benefits both users and developers. As a result, the App Store has become a vibrant and innovative platform that attracts over 650 million average weekly visitors worldwide, while providing more than 36 million registered Apple developers with a global distribution platform that supports more than 195 local payment methods and 44 currencies.
Today, Apple announced that in 2022, the App Store prevented over $2 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, and rejected nearly 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet the App Store’s high standards for privacy, security, and content.
Account Fraud
Apple rooted out 428,000 developer accounts and 282 million customer accounts for fraud and abuse last year.
Over the years, Apple has improved its systems to continuously monitor and detect account fraud quickly. In 2021, Apple terminated over 802,000 developer accounts for potentially fraudulent activity. In 2022, that number declined to 428,000 thanks in part to new methods and protocols that allow the App Store to prevent the creation of potentially fraudulent accounts. Additionally, nearly 105,000 Apple Developer Program enrollments were rejected for suspected fraudulent activities, preventing these bad actors from submitting apps to the App Store.
In 2022, Apple protected users from nearly 57,000 untrustworthy apps from illegitimate storefronts, which do not have the same built-in privacy and security protections as the App Store. These unauthorized marketplaces distribute harmful software that can imitate popular apps or alter them without the consent of their developers.
In the last 30 days alone, Apple blocked close to 3.9 million attempts to install or launch apps distributed illicitly through the Developer Enterprise Program, which allows large organizations to deploy internal apps for use by employees.
Apple also takes action against fraudulent customer accounts, and in 2022, disabled over 282 million customer accounts associated with fraudulent and abusive activity. And 198 million attempted fraudulent new accounts were blocked before they could even be created.
App Review
The App Store’s front line of defense protected users from hundreds of thousands of unsafe apps in 2022.
Apple performs a number of safety checks on every app before it makes its way onto the App Store. During the development stage, Xcode systematically inspects apps to certify they are using authorized technologies and to make sure the app meets minimum requirements for the App Store. After a developer uploads their app to App Store Connect, additional checks are run to verify it does not reference private APIs and is free of known malware. Once in review, each submission is carefully looked at by a member of the App Review team to ensure it meets Apple’s standards of quality and safety.
App Review has evolved its processes over time, and expanded its operations around the world to support developers and help get their apps onto the App Store quickly. On average, the team reviews over 100,000 app submissions a week, with nearly 90 percent of them receiving a review within 24 hours. Having reviewed more than 6.1 million app submissions in 2022, App Review helped more than 185,000 developers publish their very first app on the App Store, and made over 20,000 phone calls to developers to help them diagnose and resolve issues that led to an app submission rejection.
In 2022, nearly 1.7 million app submissions were rejected from the App Store for various reasons, including concerns related to fraud and privacy. In more than one case this year, App Review caught apps using malicious code with the potential to steal users’ credentials from third-party services. In other instances, the App Review team identified several apps that disguised themselves as innocuous financial management platforms but had the capability to morph into another app. Nearly 24,000 apps were blocked or removed from the App Store for bait-and-switch violations such as these in 2022.
There are other reasons an app can be rejected for fraud. For example, over 153,000 app submissions rejected from the App Store last year were found to be spam, copycats, or misleading, and nearly 29,000 submissions were rejected for containing hidden or undocumented features. Sometimes apps try to obtain users’ personal data without their knowledge or consent. In 2022, upward of 400,000 app submissions were rejected for privacy violations.
App Review also investigates apps reported through Apple’s Report a Problem tool and takes immediate action to remove apps that have been confirmed as fraudulent or malicious. Unapproved apps under a developer account that has been terminated for fraud and abuse are automatically removed and prevented from being submitted onto the App Store. In 2022, App Review took action to prevent nearly 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users on the App Store.
Ratings and Reviews
Apple detected and blocked more than 147 million fraudulent ratings and reviews from the App Store last year.
Ratings and reviews are an important feature of the App Store. Users rely on them to help decide which app to download, and developers use them as vital feedback for improving their apps. Inauthentic ratings and reviews from fraudulent or bot accounts can mislead users into downloading an untrustworthy app that attempts to game the system through misrepresentation. In 2022, with over 1 billion ratings and reviews processed, Apple blocked and removed more than 147 million ratings and reviews for failing to meet moderation standards.
Payment and Credit Card Fraud
Apple blocked a record $2 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2022, banning 714,000 fraudulent accounts from transacting again.
As the digital economy evolves, more and more people are turning to online payments to purchase goods and services. Apple has made tremendous investments in creating secure payment technologies like Apple Pay and StoreKit to protect people’s financial information. These technologies are used by nearly 943,000 apps to sell goods and services on the App Store.
Apple takes credit card fraud extremely seriously, and remains committed to protecting the App Store and its users from this kind of stress. For example, with Apple Pay, credit card numbers are never shared with merchants, thus eliminating a risk factor in the payment transaction process.
Last year, Apple blocked nearly 3.9 million stolen credit cards from being used to make fraudulent purchases, and banned 714,000 accounts from transacting again. In total, Apple blocked $2.09 billion in fraudulent transactions on the App Store in 2022.
Apple’s work to keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for users and developers is never done. As bad actors evolve their dishonest tactics and methods of deception, Apple supplements its antifraud initiatives with feedback gleaned from a myriad of channels — from news stories to social media to AppleCare calls — and will continue to develop new approaches and tools designed to prevent fraud from harming App Store users and developers.

May 16, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces new features for cognitive accessibility, along with Live Speech, Personal Voice, and Point and Speak in Magnifier
New software features for cognitive, speech, and vision accessibility are coming later this year
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewed software features for cognitive, vision, hearing, and mobility accessibility, along with innovative tools for individuals who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak. These updates draw on advances in hardware and software, include on-device machine learning to ensure user privacy, and expand on Apple’s long-standing commitment to making products for everyone.
Apple works in deep collaboration with community groups representing a broad spectrum of users with disabilities to develop accessibility features that make a real impact on people’s lives. Coming later this year, users with cognitive disabilities can use iPhone and iPad with greater ease and independence with Assistive Access; nonspeaking individuals can type to speak during calls and conversations with Live Speech; and those at risk of losing their ability to speak can use Personal Voice to create a synthesized voice that sounds like them for connecting with family and friends. For users who are blind or have low vision, Detection Mode in Magnifier offers Point and Speak, which identifies text users point toward and reads it out loud to help them interact with physical objects such as household appliances.
“At Apple, we’ve always believed that the best technology is technology built for everyone,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Today, we’re excited to share incredible new features that build on our long history of making technology accessible, so that everyone has the opportunity to create, communicate, and do what they love.”
“Accessibility is part of everything we do at Apple,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These groundbreaking features were designed with feedback from members of disability communities every step of the way, to support a diverse set of users and help people connect in new ways.”
Assistive Access Supports Users with Cognitive Disabilities
Assistive Access uses innovations in design to distill apps and experiences to their essential features in order to lighten cognitive load. The feature reflects feedback from people with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters — focusing on the activities they enjoy — and that are foundational to iPhone and iPad: connecting with loved ones, capturing and enjoying photos, and listening to music.
Assistive Access includes a customized experience for Phone and FaceTime, which have been combined into a single Calls app, as well as Messages, Camera, Photos, and Music. The feature offers a distinct interface with high contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help trusted supporters tailor the experience for the individual they support. For example, for users who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message to share with loved ones. Users and trusted supporters can also choose between a more visual, grid-based layout for their Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout for users who prefer text.
“The intellectual and developmental disability community is bursting with creativity, but technology often poses physical, visual, or knowledge barriers for these individuals,” said Katy Schmid, senior director of National Program Initiatives at The Arc of the United States. “To have a feature that provides a cognitively accessible experience on iPhone or iPad — that means more open doors to education, employment, safety, and autonomy. It means broadening worlds and expanding potential.”
Live Speech and Personal Voice Advance Speech Accessibility
With Live Speech on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, users can type what they want to say to have it be spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. Users can also save commonly used phrases to chime in quickly during lively conversation with family, friends, and colleagues. Live Speech has been designed to support millions of people globally who are unable to speak or who have lost their speech over time.
For users at risk of losing their ability to speak — such as those with a recent diagnosis of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or other conditions that can progressively impact speaking ability — Personal Voice is a simple and secure way to create a voice that sounds like them.
Users can create a Personal Voice by reading along with a randomized set of text prompts to record 15 minutes of audio on iPhone or iPad. This speech accessibility feature uses on-device machine learning to keep users’ information private and secure, and integrates seamlessly with Live Speech so users can speak with their Personal Voice when connecting with loved ones.1
“At the end of the day, the most important thing is being able to communicate with friends and family,” said Philip Green, board member and ALS advocate at the Team Gleason nonprofit, who has experienced significant changes to his voice since receiving his ALS diagnosis in 2018. “If you can tell them you love them, in a voice that sounds like you, it makes all the difference in the world — and being able to create your synthetic voice on your iPhone in just 15 minutes is extraordinary.”
Detection Mode in Magnifier Introduces Point and Speak for Users Who Are Blind or Have Low Vision
Point and Speak in Magnifier makes it easier for users with vision disabilities to interact with physical objects that have several text labels. For example, while using a household appliance — such as a microwave — Point and Speak combines input from the camera, the LiDAR Scanner, and on-device machine learning to announce the text on each button as users move their finger across the keypad.2Point and Speak is built into the Magnifier app on iPhone and iPad, works great with VoiceOver, and can be used with other Magnifier features such as People Detection, Door Detection, and Image Descriptions to help users navigate their physical environment.

2023-05-17,Increase,AssistiveWare ushers in next generation of augmentative and alternative communication technology,"If you can’t speak, the assumption is still that you probably don’t have much to say. That assumption is the biggest problem. I hope to see a shift toward respecting this technology so it can have the biggest impact.
David Niemeijer, AssistiveWare’s founder and CEO

AssistiveWare ushers in next generation of augmentative and alternative communication technology
How app development company AssistiveWare is innovating augmentative and alternative communication software
Every afternoon, 9-year-old Jay accompanies his mother Meghan Ashburn and his twin brother Nick to Virginia Beach, where they unwind from the day’s stimulation at school, in their home, and out in the rest of the world.
When Ashburn asks Jay why he loves the beach, he picks the “sunset” button, then says, “No school. Yes beach.”
In 2015, Jay was diagnosed with autism. By the age of 4, he started using Proloquo2Go, an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) app created by development company AssistiveWare, available for iPhone and iPad.
“The beach has always been a place where Jay can explore and relax on his terms,” Ashburn explains. “As a family, we visit as often as the weather allows. He loves the sand, the waves, and the gorgeous sunsets.”
Proloquo2Go embodies AssistiveWare’s mission: to make AAC an effective and accepted means of communication. A variety of people adopt these tools when they’re unable to produce oral speech, including those with ALS, cerebral palsy, autism, and more.
Bringing this technology to Apple devices represented a considerable shift for AAC users and David Niemeijer, AssistiveWare’s founder and CEO. With AAC available on consumer devices, the number of people who could afford and use the technology ballooned. This also enabled AssistiveWare’s rapid growth.
“One of the coolest things about the iPad and the iPhone is that they’re not separate devices,” says Niemeijer. “They’re cool devices that everyone else uses, too, and that has already made a major difference in its acceptability. But we still have more work to do.”
AssistiveWare’s next generation of AAC apps, Proloquo and Proloquo Coach, became available in 2022. Beyond generating speech, Proloquo helps users build phrases or sentences, learn related words, and expand their language and grammar. Proloquo Coach provides families and educators with the tools to support children and students in their learning.
Proloquo features 49 genuine children and adult’s text-to-speech voices and 12,000 words — about three times more than other AAC apps. AssistiveWare apps also support VoiceOver and Switch Control for users who are blind or low vision, or have limited mobility.
For AAC users, Niemeijer believes finding a customizable experience is an important step. Apple’s new accessibility features — previewed this week — include Assistive Access for people with cognitive disabilities, and Personal Voice for those at risk of losing their ability to speak, giving users more options to tailor their experiences to their needs.
“We’re really excited to integrate these new features into AssistiveWare’s apps,” Niemeijer says. “We recently released support for iOS’s built-in voices in Proloquo, so users have access to an even wider range of voices to choose from. The introduction of Personal Voice has the potential to provide our users with even more options to personalize how they communicate. This, combined with features like Assistive Access, will enrich the opportunities available to us to customize the user experience and allow users to tailor our apps to their personality and needs.”
Today, Jay uses Proloquo and other modes of communication to speak to his family, teachers, and friends. Children make up 80 percent of Proloquo users: Jay is one of the app’s 100,000 daily users and 300,000 overall users around the world.
“The awareness of AAC among the public will increase in the next five years,” says Ashburn, who previously taught elementary school. Jay learns in a general third grade class. “It’s a big deal, because he’s nonspeaking and they tend to get separated.” Jay’s third grade classmates also use Proloquo as one way of interacting with him.
“Proloquo’s unlimited sharing capability is probably my favorite feature. I can build an AAC team for Jay. His teachers, extended family, and even classmates have access to Proloquo on their personal devices for free,” Ashburn continues. “I can’t even describe how beneficial that is. It’s such a game changer in terms of leveraging AAC.”
Jay is currently experiencing improvement in his speech, and uses Proloquo to practice speaking. To learn new words, he presses the button again and again, until he can start speaking the word or phrase himself. “Shut the door” is a phrase Ashburn says she frequently hears, as Jay enters his preteen years.
“Many AAC options limit the words a child can choose from,” says Ashburn. “Proloquo has such a large vocabulary that Jay can choose almost any word he wants. The built-in keyboard makes his options limitless.”
Back in Amsterdam, AssistiveWare’s team of researchers, AAC experts, designers, developers, and quality assurance engineers — including 27 local employees and an additional 35 around the world — innovate the technology behind the products and push forward research and advocacy work around AAC. “Most research in this field looks at the change that happens upon an intervention for a single person,” Niemeijer explains. “We instead have consent-based anonymous data on tens of thousands of AAC users. That’s not common. We bring insights from a larger scale to the table, which leads to interesting conversations.”
Apple’s Guided Access, an accessibility setting introduced a decade ago to restrict devices to a single app, radically improved the app’s potential. “Before that, one of the challenges families and schools had was that the child would start in a communication app, but then jump out and go to another app,” says Niemeijer. “With Guided Access, it was possible to keep the focus on learning and communicating.”
Developing for the Apple ecosystem holds another key advantage: Apple maintains software support for years, making it a sound investment for families and schools.
“It gives us the time and space to focus on innovation,” Niemeijer says. “That way, AssistiveWare doesn’t get stuck in the past.”
For the next generation of AAC users, Niemeijer hopes this form of communication becomes as widely accepted as texting. More than developing the technology, the stigma around AAC represents the biggest hurdle for its users.
“I still think we have a long way to go,” says Niemeijer. “If you can’t speak, the assumption is still that you probably don’t have much to say. That assumption is the biggest problem. I hope to see a shift toward respecting this technology so it can have the biggest impact.”

UPDATE
Apple announces multibillion-dollar deal with Broadcom for components made in the USA
Today Apple announced a new multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement with Broadcom, a leading U.S. technology and advanced manufacturing company. Through this collaboration, Broadcom will develop 5G radio frequency components — including FBAR filters — and cutting-edge wireless connectivity components. The FBAR filters will be designed and built in several key American manufacturing and technology hubs, including Fort Collins, Colorado, where Broadcom has a major facility.
“We’re thrilled to make commitments that harness the ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit of American manufacturing,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “All of Apple’s products depend on technology engineered and built here in the United States, and we’ll continue to deepen our investments in the U.S. economy because we have an unshakable belief in America’s future.”
Apple already helps support more than 1,100 jobs in Broadcom’s Fort Collins FBAR filter manufacturing facility, and the partnership will enable Broadcom to continue to invest in critical automation projects and upskilling with technicians and engineers. Across the country, Apple supports more than 2.7 million jobs through direct employment, developer jobs in the thriving iOS app economy, and spending with more than 9,000 U.S. suppliers and manufacturers of all sizes in all 50 states across dozens of sectors.
5G technology is shaping the future of next-generation consumer electronics — and Apple is spending tens of billions of dollars to develop this field in the U.S.
These investments are part of the commitment Apple made in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over five years. Today, Apple is on pace to meet its target through direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the U.S., and other domestic spend.
Following the introduction of 5G technology to Apple devices in 2020, Apple has helped expand and expedite 5G adoption across the country, driving innovation and job growth among companies that support 5G innovation and infrastructure. 5G coverage and performance also continue to expand around the world, and more users are benefitting from faster connectivity as they upgrade to 5G-capable products.

Apple’s WWDC23 Swift Student Challenge winners code to share their passions with the world
Every year, as part of its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple issues a challenge to students across the globe: create an original app playground using the Swift coding language. This year, Apple increased the number of winners from the 350 awarded in previous years to 375 so even more students could be included in the event and recognized for their artistry and ingenuity.
“We are amazed by the talent we see from the young developers who enter our Swift Student Challenge,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “This year’s submissions demonstrated not only the next generation’s commitment to building tools that will improve our lives, but also a willingness to embrace new technologies and tools, and deploy them in original and creative ways.”
When WWDC23 kicks off June 5, the challenge winners will be among those attending virtually and in person to see the keynote, events, labs, and activities available this year to the global Apple developer community.
Their app playgrounds represent more than 30 countries and regions, and cover topics as varied as healthcare, sports, entertainment, and the environment. But there is one thing all of the winners have in common: They are using coding to share their passions with the world. For first-time winners Asmi Jain, Yemi Agesin, and Marta Michelle Caliendo, coding is an opportunity not only to forge a unique career path, but also to help others along the way.
While at Medi-Caps University in Indore, India, 20-year-old Asmi Jain found out her friend’s uncle had to undergo brain surgery. As a result, he was left with eye misalignment and facial paralysis.
Jain sprung into action, designing her winning playground to track a user’s eye movements as they try to follow a ball moving around the screen. The playground’s purpose is to help strengthen the eye muscles, and though it was inspired by her friend’s uncle, Jain hopes it can be used by people with a variety of eye conditions and injuries.
“It was important for me to create an app playground that could positively impact the lives of people like him,” says Jain. “My next goal is to get feedback and make sure it’s effective and user-friendly, and then release it on the App Store. Ultimately, I want to expand it so that it helps strengthen all of the muscles in the face, and I hope it can one day serve as a therapy tool that people like my friend’s uncle can use at their own pace.”
Jain’s desire to use coding to solve problems in the healthcare sector springs from many years spent volunteering to help those around her. Recently, she and a few other students created a forum at her university so that their classmates had a support system for working through tough coding problems.
“When you feel as though you’re part of something bigger, it motivates you and drives you to do better,” says Jain. “Coding lets me create things that help my friends and my community. And it gives me a sense of independence that is very empowering.”
For many young people, moving to different countries while growing up would be a burden, but 21-year-old Yemi Agesin saw it as a blessing. His family lived in Germany, Nigeria, Belgium, and England before returning to the United States when he was a teenager.
“You learn so much about the world when you move around,” says Agesin, who starts his final year at Kennesaw State University in Georgia this fall. “I think that really helps me because when I’m building things, I always try to consider and design for a wide range of perspectives.”
Agesin’s winning app playground is a first-person baseball game that alludes to two of his passions: sports and filmmaking. They foreshadow not only the next few months — he’s currently writing a film about a baseball player that he will produce this summer — but also his future goals.
“Coding gives me the freedom to feel like an artist — my canvas is the code editor, and my brush is the keyboard,” says Agesin. “For my next two projects, I’m designing a sports game where you compete against other players in real time in a team setting. And I’m also planning an app that will use augmented reality to help filmmakers visualize their graphics and effects while they’re shooting on iPhone.”
It’s no surprise that ARKit and RealityKit are what Agesin most looks forward to learning about when he attends WWDC23. He’s eager to add them to his growing toolbox and discover how they can help him transform his ideas into apps that make a difference.
“By using code, I can build worlds that people can use, and at the same time, build a career for myself that brings together my passions,” says Agesin. “I feel blessed and lucky that I live in a time and age where I can do that.”
For 25-year-old Marta Michelle Caliendo, her passion for paleontology — the scientific study of life through fossils — isn’t so much about the past, as it is the future.
“Dinosaurs should be a constant reminder to all of us to preserve biodiversity,” says Caliendo, who is studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Naples while also pursuing a natural sciences degree at the University of Naples Federico II. “Coding helps me find new ways to express and share that message with others.”
Caliendo’s winning app playground is a memory game featuring anatomically correct pictures of dinosaur fossils that she drew in Procreate on iPad, made all the more impressive because she only learned Swift in September.
“My first experience with Swift was when I started at the academy, and it was beautiful because it was so intuitive and simple,” says Caliendo. “I really love this programming language because it lets me share a part of my personality through my code.”
As for the future, Caliendo wants to build apps that help protect animals and the natural environment — she’s especially interested in reptiles and amphibians. It’s what led her to start planning an app that will help scientists and volunteers monitor and safeguard sea turtle nests along Italy’s coast.
“I study the animals we’ve lost to help protect the ones we still have,” says Caliendo. “We all have an opportunity to positively change things in the world, and I see technology and coding as the tools I can use to do that.”
Apple is proud to support and uplift the next generation of developers, creators, and entrepreneurs through its annual WWDC student program. Over the past three decades, thousands of students have built successful careers in technology, founded startups, and created organizations focused on democratizing technology and using it to build a better future.

PRESS RELEASE
App Store developers generated $1.1 trillion in total billings and sales in the App Store ecosystem in 2022
More than 90 percent of billings and sales accrued solely to developers, without any commission paid to AppleNew study underscores the strength and resilience of the App Store ecosystem — with billings and sales facilitated by the App Store growing 29 percent year over year
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the App Store ecosystem facilitated $1.1 trillion in developer billings and sales in 2022, building on developers’ track record of strong, resilient growth, anindependent study by economists from Analysis Groupfound. The App Store continues to create incredible opportunity for developers around the world, with more than 90 percent of the billings and sales accruing solely to developers and businesses of all sizes — without any commission paid to Apple. Additionally, new analysis from the Progressive Policy Institute found the iOS app economy now supports more than 4.8 million jobs across the U.S. and Europe, with approximately 2.4 million in each region.
Today, developers on the App Store have more ways than ever to monetize their apps and build successful businesses. The economists from Analysis Group estimate that last year, App Store developers generated $910 billion in total billings and sales from the sale of physical goods and services, $109 billion from in-app advertising, and $104 billion for digital goods and services.
“We’ve never been more hopeful about — or more inspired by — the incredible community of developers around the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “As this report shows, the App Store is a vibrant, innovative marketplace where opportunity thrives, and we’re as committed as ever to investing in developers’ success and the app economy’s future.”
The Analysis Group study takes a closer look at the key drivers behind the growth in the App Store ecosystem — including rebounding demand for sectors like travel and ride-hailing, and strong growth in advertising spend in apps like social media and retail apps.
Developer billings and sales increased by 27 percent between 2019 and 2020; 27 percent between 2020 and 2021; and 29 percent between 2021 and 2022. Small developers in particular found tremendous success on the App Store — outpacing larger developers bygrowing their revenue by 71 percent between 2020 and 2022. The economists at Analysis Group believe growth rates of this kind are positive indicators, consistent with a flourishing marketplace full of dynamism, innovation, and competition.
All told, since 2019, U.S. developers’ billings and sales have increased by more than 80 percent. In Europe, developers’ billings and sales since 2019 saw an above average increase of 116 percent.
The App Store’s engine of commerce provides Apple developers around the world with a global distribution platform that supports more than 195 local payment methods and 44 currencies across 175 storefronts. It also allowed developers to reach users across borders: In 2022, 54 percent of downloads occurred in storefronts outside of developers’ home countries. The App Store attracted over 650 million average weekly visitors worldwide in 2022, according to new data from Apple. And users downloaded and redownloaded apps an average of more than 747 million and 1.5 billion times each week in 2022, respectively.
Strong Growth in Billings and Sales Across App Categories
Released earlier today, the new study from economists at Analysis Group, titled “The Continued Growth and Resilience of Apple’s App Store Ecosystem,” draws from a wide range of economic data that speaks to developers’ growth on the App Store. The study found developers’ billings and sales facilitated by the App Store grew across a wide variety of categories.
For example, as restrictions eased in many parts of the world, app categories like travel and ride-hailing saw demand rebound significantly. Travel sales made on iOS apps increased by 84 percent in 2022, alongside a 45 percent increase in sales on ride-hailing apps.
Food and grocery sales were also among the fastest-growing app categories. Since 2019, iOS app-based food delivery and pickup sales more than doubled, and grocery sales more than tripled. In addition, enterprise apps have grown in popularity with companies around the world in the last few years. In 2022, these apps represented one of the fastest-growing digital goods and services categories in Analysis Group’s estimate of billings and sales. The highest growth in digital goods and services was seen in the app-based entertainment category, as notable trends like the creator economy have emerged in recent years, as well as the prominence of apps that support this area.
The broad-based growth of developer businesses — across app categories — speaks to the many ways Apple users have come to rely on their favorite apps in so many aspects of their lives. Whether for gaming or productivity, education or social media, apps are helping people around the world stay connected, creative, and entertained.
The App Store Turns Fifteen
Fifteen years since its launch in 2008, the App Store has never offered developers more opportunities, or Apple users more apps that enrich their lives. That success comes as Apple continues investing in the future of the app economy. By offering a safe and trusted marketplace for users, and powerful tools that help developers make great apps, the App Store has created an incredible economic opportunity for global app creators.
All told, iOS developers have earned more than $320 billion on the App Store from 2008 to 2022. The Analysis Group study found that iOS users have downloaded apps more than 370 billion times from 2008 to 2022. And today, the App Store has more than 123 times as many apps — nearly 1.8 million — to choose from, compared to the thousands available on the App Store at the end of 2008.
Today’s developers also have more options to monetize their businesses, including in-app purchases and subscriptions; more developer tools, including over 40 SDKs and 250,000 APIs; and educational resources like Apple’s Developer Academies, Entrepreneur Camp, and other programs that teach coding and business development skills.
The App Store’s technologies and services support a wide range of app businesses, including developers who sell physical goods and services. That includes integration with Apple Pay, biometric authentication with Face ID and Touch ID, account security, and other technologies that help developers securely connect with Apple users.
The App Store has also remained a safe and trusted marketplace for users, thanks to Apple’s rigorous App Review process and robust privacy and security protections. In 2022, the App Store blocked more than $2 billion in fraudulent transactions — and rejected 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet privacy, security, and quality standards. Recent innovations, like App Tracking Transparency and Privacy Nutrition Labels, have empowered users with even more information on how their apps use their data.

PRESS RELEASE
Introducing Apple Vision Pro: Apple’s first spatial computer
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today unveiledApple Vision Pro, a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, while allowing users to stay present and connected to others. Vision Pro creates an infinite canvas for apps that scales beyond the boundaries of a traditional display and introduces a fully three-dimensional user interface controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. Featuring visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in a way that feels like it is physically present in their space. The breakthrough design of Vision Pro features an ultra-high-resolution display system that packs 23 million pixels across two displays, and custom Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design to ensure every experience feels like it’s taking place in front of the user’s eyes in real time.
“Today marks the beginning of a new era for computing,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Just as the Mac introduced us to personal computing, and iPhone introduced us to mobile computing, Apple Vision Pro introduces us to spatial computing. Built upon decades of Apple innovation, Vision Pro is years ahead and unlike anything created before — with a revolutionary new input system and thousands of groundbreaking innovations. It unlocks incredible experiences for our users and exciting new opportunities for our developers.”
“Creating our first spatial computer required invention across nearly every facet of the system,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Technology Development Group. “Through a tight integration of hardware and software, we designed a standalone spatial computer in a compact wearable form factor that is the most advanced personal electronics device ever.”
Extraordinary New Experiences
Apple Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their favorite apps, capture and relive memories, enjoy stunning TV shows and movies, and connect with others in FaceTime.
An infinite canvas for apps at work and at home: visionOS features a three-dimensional interface that frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale. Apple Vision Pro enables users to be even more productive, with infinite screen real estate, access to their favorite apps, and all-new ways to multitask. And with support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace or bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text.
Engaging entertainment experiences:With two ultra-high-resolution displays, Apple Vision Pro can transform any space into a personal movie theater with a screen that feels 100 feet wide and an advanced Spatial Audio system. Users can watch movies and TV shows, or enjoy stunning three-dimensional movies. Apple Immersive Video offers 180-degree high-resolution recordings with Spatial Audio, and users can access an exciting lineup of immersive videos that transport them to entirely new places.
Spatial computing makes new types of games possible with titles that can span a spectrum of immersion and bring gamers into all-new worlds. Users can also play over 100 Apple Arcade games on a screen as large as they want, with incredible immersive audio and support for popular game controllers.
Immersive Environments:With Environments, a user’s world can grow beyond the dimensions of a physical room with dynamic, beautiful landscapes that can help them focus or reduce clutter in busy spaces.A twist of the Digital Crown lets a user control how present or immersed they are in an environment.
Memories come alive: Featuring Apple’s first three-dimensional camera, Apple Vision Pro lets users capture, relive, and immerse themselves in favorite memories with Spatial Audio. Every spatial photo and video transports users back to a moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering. Users can access their entire photo library on iCloud, and view their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail. Every Panorama shot on iPhone expands and wraps around the user, creating the sensation they are standing right where it was taken.
FaceTime becomes spatial:With Apple Vision Pro, FaceTime calls take advantage of the room around the user, with everyone on the call reflected in life-size tiles, as well as Spatial Audio, so it sounds as if participants are speaking right from where they are positioned. Users wearing Vision Pro during a FaceTime call are reflected as a Persona — a digital representation of themselves created using Apple’s most advanced machine learning techniques — which reflects face and hand movements in real time. Users can do things together like watch a movie, browse photos, or collaborate on a presentation.
Even more app experiences: Apple Vision Pro has an all-new App Store where users can discover apps and content from developers, and access hundreds of thousands of familiar iPhone and iPad apps that run great and automatically work with the new input system for Vision Pro. Apple’s developer community can go even further and take advantage of the powerful and unique capabilities of Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences, and reimagine existing ones for spatial computing.
A Revolutionary Operating System and User Interface
Built on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, visionOS was designed from the ground up to support the low-latency requirements of spatial computing. The result is a revolutionary operating system that delivers powerful spatial experiences that can take advantage of the space around the user, unlocking new opportunities at work and at home.
visionOS features a brand-new three-dimensional interface that makes digital content look and feel present in a user’s physical world. By responding dynamically to natural light and casting shadows, it helps the user understand scale and distance. To enable user navigation and interaction with spatial content, Apple Vision Pro introduces an entirely new input system controlled by a person’s eyes, hands, and voice. Users can browse through apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using voice to dictate.
Apple Vision Pro also features EyeSight, an extraordinary innovation that helps users stay connected with those around them. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device feels transparent — letting the user see them while also displaying the user’s eyes. When a user is immersed in an environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.
Breakthrough Design
Apple Vision Pro builds on Apple innovation and experience designing high-performance products like Mac, iPhone, and wearables like Apple Watch, culminating in the most advanced personal electronics device ever. To achieve ambitious goals for performance, mobility, and wearability, Apple utilized the most advanced materials possible.
Apple Vision Pro has an astonishing amount of technology in a compact design. A singular piece of three-dimensionally formed and laminated glass is polished to create an optical surface that acts as a lens for the wide array of cameras and sensors needed to blend the physical world with digital content. The glass flows into the custom aluminum alloy frame that gently curves around the user’s face, while the modular system allows for a tailored fit to accommodate a wide range of people. The Light Seal is made of a soft textile, and comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to a user’s face for a precise fit. Flexible straps ensure audio remains close to the user’s ears, while a Head Band — available in multiple sizes — is three-dimensionally knitted as a single piece to provide cushioning, breathability, and stretch.1The band is secured with a simple mechanism, making it easy to change to another size or style of band.
Unrivaled Innovation in Hardware
Apple Vision Pro is designed to deliver phenomenal compute performance in a compact wearable form factor. Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of an Apple silicon chip, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide color and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom catadioptric lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, delivers jaw-dropping experiences. Users with vision correction needs will use ZEISS Optical Inserts to ensure visual fidelity and eye tracking accuracy.2
An advanced Spatial Audio system is core to the Apple Vision Pro experience, creating the feeling that sounds are coming from the environment around the user and matching the sound to the space. Two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user’s own head and ear geometry.3
In addition to creating a breakthrough display and advanced audio experiences, the high-performance eye tracking system in Apple Vision Pro uses high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the user’s eyes for responsive, intuitive input.
These groundbreaking innovations are powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. M2 delivers unparalleled standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user’s eyes, in real time. R1 streams new images to the displays within 12 milliseconds — 8x faster than the blink of an eye. Apple Vision Pro is designed for all-day use when plugged in, and up to two hours of use with its external, high-performance battery.
Industry-Leading Privacy and Security
Apple Vision Pro is built on a strong foundation of privacy and security, and keeps users in control of their data.
Optic ID is a new secure authentication system that analyzes a user’s iris under various invisible LED light exposures, and then compares it to the enrolled Optic ID data that is protected by the Secure Enclave to instantly unlock Apple Vision Pro. A user’s Optic ID data is fully encrypted, is not accessible to apps, and never leaves their device, meaning it is not stored on Apple servers.
Where a user looks stays private while navigating Apple Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. Additionally, data from the camera and other sensors is processed at the system level, so individual apps do not need to see a user’s surroundings to enable spatial experiences. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.
Pricing and Availability
Apple Vision Pro starts at$3,499(U.S.), and will be available early next year onapple.comand at Apple Store locations in the U.S., with more countries coming later next year. Customers will be able to learn about, experience, and personalize their fit for Vision Pro at Apple Store locations. For more information about Vision Pro, visitapple.com/apple-vision-pro.

“With watchOS 10, we’ve redesigned the interface, allowing users to experience Apple Watch like never before,” said Alan Dye, Apple’s vice president of Human Interface Design. “The update gives users the information that matters most to them at a glance, simplified navigation, and a new visual language that takes full advantage of the Apple Watch display. We’re also introducing the Smart Stack, offering quick access to proactive and relevant information, right from the watch face.”
Apple Watch apps, including Weather, Stocks, Home, Maps, Messages, World Clock, and others, now utilize more of the Apple Watch display for more glanceable information. The Activity app on Apple Watch and the Fitness app on iPhone make tracking daily movement even easier with more details, improvements to sharing, a redesigned trophy case, and Apple Fitness+ trainer tips.
A new Smart Stack contains widgets that display timely information that adapts to the user’s context and can be revealed with a simple turn of the Digital Crown from any watch face. For example, at the beginning of the day, Weather will show the forecast, or, when traveling, the Smart Stack will show boarding passes from Wallet. Calendar and Reminders will reshuffle to the top to display upcoming meetings or tasks, and apps that are running, such as Podcasts, will also move up so they are readily available. Smart Stack also enables users to enjoy a beautiful watch face, like Portraits, while still offering a way to quickly access information they care about.
Developers can also use the new design language to update their apps. For example, Streaks now utilizes the entire display to easily show progress and access tasks, the NBA app makes keeping up with a favorite team even more compelling with team colors and new game details, and with Waterllama’s redesign, users can quickly glance at their hydration from the last seven days with just a turn of the Digital Crown.
Control Center is now accessible using the side button, making it easy to quickly open it at any time, over any app. A double-click of the Digital Crown reverts back to any apps used recently.
New Watch Faces
watchOS 10 introduces two new artistic and joyful watch faces: Palette and Snoopy. The Palette face depicts time in a wide variety of colors using three distinct overlapping layers, and as the time changes, the colors on the display also shift.
Additionally, the beloved comic stripPeanutscomes to life on Apple Watch with a new watch face featuring Snoopy and Woodstock. The characters interact and play with the watch hands, react to the weather conditions in the area, or even get active when the user does a workout.
Cycling
Apple Watch is a great device for cyclists, with features including automatic Workout reminders, calorimetry for e-biking, and Fall Detection. watchOS 10 takes this popular activity even further with advanced new metrics, views, and experiences.
When a cycling workout is started from Apple Watch in watchOS 10, it will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and, when tapped, will utilize the full screen. Workout Views, such as Heart Rate Zones, Elevation, Race Route, Custom Workouts, and a new Cycling Speed view, have been optimized for the display size of iPhone, which can be mounted to a bike for convenient, easy viewing during a ride.
Apple Watch can now automatically connect to Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories, such as power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors. This enables brand-new metrics, including cycling power (watts) and cadence (RPM), and additional Workout Views, including Power Zones. Bluetooth connection is supported for Indoor and Outdoor cycling workouts, as well as GymKit.
New algorithms combining sensor data from Apple Watch and connected power meters can estimate Functional Threshold Power (FTP), the highest level of cycling intensity that a rider could theoretically maintain for an hour. Using FTP, Apple Watch calculates personalized Power Zones, used to easily see the current zone and track how long is spent in each, which is an effective and popular way of improving performance.
Hiking
The Compass app on Apple Watch is a helpful tool for exploring the great outdoors. With watchOS 10, Compass automatically generates two new waypoints: A Last Cellular Connection Waypoint will estimate the last place with cellular reception, which may be useful for checking messages or making a call. In case of emergencies, a Last Emergency Call Waypoint will estimate where on the route their device had the last connection to any available carrier’s network so that an emergency call can be made.
When preparing routes, a new Elevation view uses altimeter data, offering a three-dimensional view of saved waypoints. And starting in the U.S., Apple Maps displays a new topographic map featuring contour lines, hill shading, elevation details, and points of interest. Users can also search for nearby trails and trailheads, with place cards that include detailed information, like trail length, type, and difficulty.
Mental Health
Mental health is as important as physical health, and research shows that reflecting on state of mind can help build emotional awareness and resilience. With the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10, users can discreetly and conveniently log their momentary emotions and daily moods. Users can turn the Digital Crown to scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes to choose how they are feeling, select what is having the biggest impact on them, and describe their feelings.
In the Health app in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, users can see valuable insights to identify what might be contributing to their state of mind — whether it’s associations or lifestyle factors, like sleep or exercise. Additionally, depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics are now easily accessible in the Health app and can help users determine their risk level, connect to resources available in their region, and create a PDF to share with their doctor.
Vision Health
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the leading cause of vision impairment globally. To reduce the risk of myopia, the International Myopia Institute recommends children spend at least 80-120 minutes a day outdoors. With watchOS 10, Apple Watch introduces the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor. Users can view this information in the Health app on iPhone or iPad.
Time spent in daylight can provide additional benefits to physical and mental health for all ages. And children who do not have their own iPhone can use Family Setup to pair their Apple Watch to their parent’s iPhone, giving parents visibility into the amount of time their kids are spending in daylight with Health Sharing.
Viewing something like a device or a book too closely has also been documented as a myopia risk factor. The new Screen Distance feature uses the same TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID in iPad and iPhone to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches for an extended period of time.
When a device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all Health app data, including mental health and vision health data, is encrypted.1
Additional watchOS 10 updates include:
Enterprise
Apple Watch offers enterprise customers features to enhance productivity and safety in the office or in the field, such as hands-free communication and responding to notifications on the go, or Fall Detection on a job site. watchOS 10 introduces support for Mobile Device Management (MDM), enabling enterprise customers to remotely and centrally install apps and configure accounts on a fleet of devices, with features such as passcode enforcement, and configuring Wi-Fi and VPN settings. With this update, Apple Watch can further help improve employee wellness, productivity and health, and safety monitoring.
APIs for Workout App Developers
watchOS 10 includes new APIs for workout app developers that will allow them to create compelling new experiences. The powerful motion sensors on both Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra can detect rapid changes in velocity and acceleration, such as when swinging a golf club or a tennis racket. Now, developers will have access to this high-frequency motion data, so apps like SwingVision can analyze serve pronation, which is the twisting motion of the forearm, wrist, and hand, and Golfshot can detect small wrist movements to refine a golf swing.
Popular coaching platforms such as TrainingPeaks can use a new API to create a Custom Workout that can be imported directly into the Workout app. App developers using HealthKit for workouts will be able to provide validated calories for golf workouts, as the variation between using a golf cart or walking on the green is now identified. Developers can also access speed, cadence, and power metrics for cycling, plus mirror workouts from Apple Watch to iPhone.
Availability
The developer beta of watchOS 10 is available to Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today. A public beta will be available to watchOS users next month atbeta.apple.com. watchOS 10 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 4 or later paired with iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 17. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages, or on all devices. Features are subject to change. For more information, visitapple.com/watchos/watchos-preview.

PRESS RELEASE
iOS 17 makes iPhone more personal and intuitive
The release introduces major updates to communications apps, easier sharing with AirDrop, more intelligent text input, and new experiences with Journal and StandBy
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcediOS 17, a major release that upgrades the communications experience across Phone, FaceTime, and Messages; makes sharing even easier with AirDrop; and provides more intelligent input that improves the speed and accuracy of typing. iOS 17 also introduces new experiences with Journal, an app that makes it easy for people to practice gratitude, and StandBy, a new way to view glanceable information when iPhone is set down and charging.
“With iOS 17, we’ve made iPhone more personal and intuitive by deeply considering the features we all rely on every day,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “Phone, FaceTime, and Messages are central to how we communicate, and this release is packed with updates we think our users are going to love. We’ve also reimagined AirDrop with new ways to share, autocorrect gets even better, and we’re introducing all-new experiences with Journal and StandBy, plus so much more. We can’t wait for everyone to try it.”
Major Upgrades to the Phone Experience
The Phone app is central to the iPhone experience, and it receives a big update with personalized Contact Posters, providing a new way for users to express themselves. Users can customize how they appear, bringing a completely new look to incoming calls, and choose beautiful treatments for photos or Memoji, as well as eye-catching typography and font colors. Contact Posters will also be available for third-party calling apps.
Live Voicemail gives users the ability to see real-time transcription as someone leaves a voicemail, and the opportunity to pick up while the caller is leaving their message. Calls identified as spam by carriers won’t appear as Live Voicemail, and will instead be instantly declined. With the power of the Neural Engine, Live Voicemail transcription is handled on-device and remains entirely private.
FaceTime Adds Audio and Video Messages, Reactions, and Extends to Apple TV
FaceTime now supports audio and video messages so when users call someone who is not available, they can share a message that can be enjoyed later.
FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video calling apps can take advantage of them as well.
In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPhone and then hand it off to Apple TV, to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room.
A Fresh Look and Big Updates to Messages
Messages gets significant updates with iOS 17, including an all-new stickers experience with new emoji stickers and the ability to create Live Stickers by lifting subjects from photos. Users can also add effects to Live Stickers that bring them to life, and a new drawer in the keyboard puts all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iOS.
New Messages features enhance the way users communicate. An expandable menu that can be accessed with a simple tap to display iMessage apps gives Messages a sleeker look. Search gets more powerful and precise with search filters, making it possible for users to start a search and add additional filters to narrow down the results and find exactly what they are seeking. A new catch-up arrow indicates where the user last left off in the conversation, and replying inline is as simple as swiping on a text bubble. If a user shares their location, it will update in real time right in the conversation. When sending an audio message, it’s transcribed automatically so users can read it in the moment or listen later.
Messages also introduces Check In, an important feature for when a user wants to notify a family member or friend that they have made it to their destination safely. After a user initiates a Check In, their friend or family member will automatically be notified as soon as the user arrives. If they are not making progress toward their destination, useful information will be temporarily shared with the selected contact, such as the device’s location, battery level, and cell service status. Any information shared is end-to-end encrypted.
Easier Sharing with AirDrop and NameDrop
AirDrop makes it easy to share a file with a colleague or send photos to a friend in seconds, and with iOS 17, AirDrop gets new ways to share. NameDrop allows users to easily share contact information by simply bringing their iPhones together, or by bringing an iPhone and Apple Watch together.1With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity between iPhone devices.
Improvements to Autocorrect and Dictation Deliver More Intelligent Input
Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction — improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. It also receives a refreshed design to better support typing, and sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes. Users will now receive predictive text recommendations inline as they type, so adding entire words or completing sentences is as easy as tapping the space bar, making text entry faster than ever. Dictation leverages a new speech recognition model to make it even more accurate.
StandBy Displays Glanceable Information While iPhone Is Charging
iOS 17 introduces StandBy, giving users a full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. StandBy is perfect on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or desk, and can be personalized to display a range of beautiful clock styles, favorite photos, or widgets, including Smart Stacks, which surface the right widgets at the right time. With support for Live Activities, Siri, incoming calls, and larger notifications, StandBy makes iPhone even more useful when viewed at a distance. When charging with MagSafe, StandBy remembers a user’s preferred view. It is easy to bring up StandBy anytime by tapping the screen, and on iPhone 14 Pro with the Always-On display, it is always available.
A New Way to Appreciate Life’s Moments with Journal
Journal is a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, which has been shown to improve wellbeing. Using on-device machine learning, personalized suggestions can be provided to help inspire a user’s journal entry. Suggestions are intelligently curated from recent activity, including photos, people, places, workouts, and more, making it easy to start a journal entry, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps.2
Additional features in iOS 17 include:

PRESS RELEASE
Apple provides powerful insights into new areas of health
iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and watchOS 10 introduce mental health and vision health features, and the Health app arrives on iPad
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced new health features in iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and watchOS 10, expanding into two impactful areas and providing innovative tools and experiences across platforms.
New mental health features allow users to log their momentary emotions and daily moods, see valuable insights, and easily access assessments and resources. iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offer new vision health features that encourage healthy behaviors that help reduce the risk of myopia, and theHealth appcomes to iPad, giving users new ways to see their health data. All of these new features — and existing health features — are grounded in science and built with privacy at the core.
“Our goal is to empower people to take charge of their own health journey. With these innovative new features, we’re expanding the comprehensive range of health and wellness tools that we offer our users across iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch,” said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health. “Mental health and vision health are important, but often overlooked, and we’re excited to introduce features that offer valuable new insights to provide users with an even better understanding of their health. These insights help support users in their daily decisions and offer more informed conversations with their doctors.”
Mental Health
Mental health is as important as physical health and affects people every day in how they think, feel, and act.
Research shows that reflecting on one’s own mental state can help build emotional awareness and resilience. According to Dr. Michelle Craske, a distinguished professor of psychology and psychiatry at UCLA, who echoes many in the field, “Identifying our feelings has been shown to help us manage difficult emotions, appreciate positive moments, and improve wellbeing.” Multiple studies by researchers have shown that identifying feelings reduces emotions like sadness and anger, and positively impacts our body by slowing our heart rate. Additionally, in a survey of participants in the UCLA Digital Mental Health Study, initial results showed more than 80 percent of participants found reflecting on their mood in the study app increased emotional awareness, and about half said it increased wellbeing.
The Health app in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, and the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10, bring an engaging and intuitive way for users to reflect on their state of mind. Users can scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes and choose how they are feeling in a range from Very Pleasant to Very Unpleasant. Then, they can select associations that are having the biggest impact on their feelings, like Travel or Family, and describe their feelings, such as Grateful or Worried.
In the Health app, users can see valuable insights to identify what might be contributing to their state of mind — whether it’s associations or lifestyle factors, such as sleep or exercise — and can use these insights to better manage their overall health.
There may be times when users can benefit from additional support. In a recent survey, more than 30 percent of U.S. adults said they have experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression.1The same depression and anxiety assessments often used in clinics are now easily accessible in the Health app and can be taken anytime. These assessments can help users determine their risk level, connect to resources available in their region, and create a PDF to share with their doctor.
These new features enable iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch users across the world to better care for their mental health, and in doing so, help raise awareness and acceptance for this important topic.
Vision Health
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the leading cause of vision impairment globally. It’s estimated to affect over 30 percent of the population currently2and expected to grow to 50 percent, or 5 billion people,3by 2050.
Eye care providers recommend a few key behaviors in children to help reduce the risk of myopia. Two of these behaviors are spending more time outdoors in daylight and increasing the distance at which they view something like a device or a book.
The International Myopia Institute recommends children spend at least 80-120 minutes a day outdoors. With watchOS 10, Apple Watch introduces the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor. Users can view the amount of time spent in daylight detected by their Apple Watch in the Health app in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17. Children who do not have their own iPhone can use Family Setup to pair their Apple Watch to their parent’s iPhone, giving parents visibility into the amount of time their kids are spending in daylight with Health Sharing. Time spent in daylight can provide additional benefits to physical and mental health, so this feature is available to all watchOS 10 users.
Viewing something like a device or a book at too close of a distance is also a well-documented myopia risk factor. The new Screen Distance feature uses the same TrueDepth camera that powers Face ID on iPhone and iPad to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches for an extended period of time. Screen Distance can remind younger users to engage in healthy viewing habits that can lower their risk of myopia, and it gives adult users the opportunity to reduce digital eyestrain.
The Health App Comes to iPad
The Health app is a central, secure, and private place for a user’s health and fitness information, and it provides users with meaningful insights to live a healthier life. In iPadOS 17, the Health app comes to iPad and has been designed to give users rich detail at a glance so they can see information from iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch, as well as compatible third-party apps and devices, all in one place.
Now users can track and manage their medications, use Cycle Tracking, log their momentary emotions and daily moods, view their available health records from multiple institutions, and more directly on iPad. They can also choose to share data stored in the Health app with loved ones or caregivers using Health Sharing. On iPad, the design of the Health app is optimized for the large display, with a new look for Favorites and detailed interactive charts. Users can receive insights into their health data with Trends and Highlights, and use iPadOS features like Split View to multitask with other apps while they view their health data.
Health and fitness developers can now use HealthKit on iPad, opening up new opportunities to create innovative health and fitness experiences that incorporate data users choose to share from the Health app, with rigorous privacy and data security protocols.
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s health features. Apple’s health and fitness features put users’ privacy at the center and provide them with protections, including transparency and control.
When iPhone and iPad are locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted on device. Additionally, health data synced to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. And if a user has a recent version4of watchOS, iOS, and iPadOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, their health and activity data will be stored in a way that Apple can’t read it.
Data in the Health app is never shared with any third party without the user’s explicit permission, and if users decide to share their health data, the Health app provides users with granular control over the types of data they share and who they share it with. They can review and manage permissions at any time.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple announces powerful new privacy and security features
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced its latest privacy and security innovations, including major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety, and Lockdown Mode, as well as app privacy improvements. Additionally, Apple introduced new features designed with privacy and security at their core, including Check In, NameDrop, and Live Voicemail. These new efforts are the latest manifestation of Apple’s deeply held belief that privacy is a fundamental human right and that good privacy is built on a foundation of strong security.
“Privacy is designed into every new Apple product and feature from the beginning,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We are focused on keeping our users in the driver’s seat when it comes to their data by continuing to provide industry-leading privacy features and the best data security in the world. This approach is evident in a number of features on our platforms, like the major updates to Safari Private Browsing, as well as the expansion of Lockdown Mode.”
Privacy Features Give Users Greater Control of Their Data
Major Updates to Safari Private BrowsingSafari introduced private browsing years before any other browser. This year, a significant update provides even greater protection against trackers as users browse the web and from people who might have access to their device. Advanced tracking and fingerprinting protections go even further to help prevent websites from using the latest techniques to track or identify a user’s device. Private Browsing now locks when not in use, allowing a user to keep tabs open even when stepping away from the device.
Photos Privacy Permission ImprovementsA new embedded Photos picker can help users share specific photos with apps while keeping the rest of their library private. When apps ask to access the user’s entire photo library, the user will be shown more information about what they’ll be sharing, along with occasional reminders of their choice.
Link Tracking Protection in Messages, Mail, and Safari Private BrowsingSome websites add extra information to their URLs in order to track users across other websites. Now this information will be removed from the links users share in Messages and Mail, and the links will still work as expected. This information will also be removed from links in Safari Private Browsing.
App Privacy ImprovementsNew tools give developers more information about the data practices of third-party software development kits (SDKs) they use in their apps, allowing them to provide even more accurate Privacy Nutrition Labels. These changes also improve the integrity of the software supply chain by supporting signatures for third-party SDKs to add another layer of protection against abuse.
Features Designed to Help Protect User Safety
Communication SafetyCommunication Safety, designed to warn children when receiving or sending photos in Messages that contain nudity, now covers video content in addition to still images. A new API lets developers integrate Communication Safety right into their apps. Additionally, the feature will now help keep kids safe when they’re sending and receiving an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and when using the Phone app to receive a Contact Poster and the Photos picker to choose content to send. All image and video processing for Communication Safety occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content. These warnings will be turned on for the child accounts in their Family Sharing plan, and can be disabled by the parent.
Sensitive Content WarningSensitive Content Warning helps adult users avoid seeing unwanted nude images and videos when receiving them in Messages, an AirDrop, a FaceTime video message, and the Phone app when receiving a Contact Poster, all using the same privacy-preserving technology at the core of Communication Safety. The feature is optional and can be turned on by the user in Privacy & Security settings. As with Communication Safety, all image and video processing for Sensitive Content Warning occurs on device, meaning neither Apple nor any third party gets access to the content.
Powerful Security Protections to Safeguard User Data
Passwords and Passkeys UpdatesFor easier and more secure password and passkey sharing, users can create a group to share a set of passwords, and everyone in the group can add and edit passwords to keep them up to date. Since sharing is through iCloud Keychain, it is end-to-end encrypted. Additionally, one-time verification codes received in Mail will now automatically autofill in Safari, making it easy to securely log in without leaving the browser.
Lockdown ModeLockdown Mode expands to provide even more protections for those who may be targeted by mercenary spyware because of who they are or what they do. New protections encompass safer wireless connectivity defaults, media handling, media sharing defaults, sandboxing, and network security optimizations. Turning on Lockdown Mode further hardens device defenses and strictly limits certain functionalities, sharply reducing the attack surface for those who need additional protections. Additionally, Lockdown Mode will be supported on watchOS.
Additional Features Designed with Privacy and Security at Their Core
These features will be coming in free software updates this fall.

PRESS RELEASE
tvOS 17 brings FaceTime and video conferencing to the biggest screen in the home
Apple TV 4K packs endless entertainment and fun into one living room device, including movies, shows, music, games, fitness, and now video calls
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced software updates coming this fall that make Apple TV 4K even more enjoyable, interactive, and fun for the whole household. With tvOS 17, FaceTime comes to Apple TV 4K, so users — for the first time ever — can enjoy the popular app on their TV for even more engaging conversations with family and friends. tvOS 17 also introduces an all-new Control Center, along with other enhancements that provide a more personalized experience that works even better with iPhone. Apple TV 4K brings together Apple TV+ and all of the most popular streaming apps — in cinematic picture and audio quality — as well as Apple Music, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Arcade to the biggest screen in the home. Boasting the powerful performance of the A15 Bionic chip, intuitive controls, and seamless interaction with Apple devices and smart home accessories, Apple TV 4K is the best living room device. tvOS 17 is available as a developer beta today, and it will be available as a free software update this fall.
“tvOS 17 transforms the biggest screen in the home with FaceTime and new video conferencing capabilities, giving Apple TV 4K users the ability to easily connect with anyone right from their living room,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “New features and enhancements make Apple TV simpler to use and even more enjoyable, reinforcing it as the absolute best option in the living room for Apple customers.”
Starting this fall, Apple TV 4K users can take advantage of the new FaceTime app on Apple TV and initiate calls directly from Apple TV, or start calls on iPhone or iPad, and hand them off to Apple TV. FaceTime on Apple TV takes advantage of Continuity Camera support to wirelessly connect to the user’s iPhone or iPad, and leverages the device’s camera and microphone to bring participants together on the TV.
Center Stage keeps everyone in the room perfectly framed on the screen, even as they move around, while new gesture-based reactions allow callers to use their hands to generate onscreen effects, such as hearts or fireworks, and add even more fun to the conversation. The introduction of Split View for Apple TV lets users enjoy watching shows or movies with their loved ones during a SharePlay session while also seeing everyone on the FaceTime call.
Controls on iPhone or iPad make it easy to transfer a FaceTime call back to those devices as needed. If another FaceTime or phone call comes in during a session, a notification appears on the TV to let the user know someone is calling — without revealing who the caller is, to preserve the user’s privacy on a communal device.
Later this year, video conferencing apps like Webex by Cisco and Zoom will launch on tvOS, bringing their communications capabilities to Apple TV 4K. Developers can take advantage of Continuity Camera APIs on Apple TV 4K to integrate the iPhone or iPad camera and microphone into their tvOS app, and create new shared and immersive entertainment experiences for the living room.
Apple Music Sing — a feature that lets users sing along to their favorite tracks — will also integrate Continuity Camera so users can see themselves onscreen and add entertaining filters.
A More Personalized Experience That Works Even Better with iPhone
The new Control Center on Apple TV makes it easier than ever for users to access key settings and information throughout the entire Apple TV experience. Control Center now displays system status, including the time and active profile, and expands with other helpful details based on a user’s activity.
tvOS 17 strengthens the seamless integration of Apple TV and iPhone with the ability to locate the Siri Remote. Users can launch the Apple TV remote inside Control Center on iPhone to find their Siri Remote (2nd generation or later). As users get closer to the remote, an onscreen circle grows in size to guide their movement.
In addition, when using the remote on iPhone to wake up and control Apple TV, users will be automatically switched to their profile, ensuring they have access to their recently watched shows and personalized recommendations. Additional settings and preferences are now saved for each user profile, including their system language and paired AirPods, delivering an even more personalized experience.
Screen saver enhancements provide a more beautiful and even more customized experience on Apple TV, as users can now enjoy curated Memories from their personal library, shared library, or both on the big screen. The widely popular aerial screen savers will feature a collection of stunning new locations, including Arizona’s Monument Valley and California’s coastal redwoods.
Additional features coming with tvOS 17 include:

A Personalized and Beautiful Lock Screen Experience
Taking full advantage of the iPad display, users can now customize the Lock Screen to make it more personal, useful, and beautiful. Rich new photo features allow users to set their favorite images on the Lock Screen and stylize them in new ways. Users can select a photo from their personal library, a dynamic set of photos that shuffle throughout the day, or a Live Photo for a smooth slow-motion effect whenever they wake iPad.
Users can choose a wallpaper from the Lock Screen gallery that will look stunning on the large canvas of iPad, pick from a set of expressive font styles and colors to customize the look of the date and time, or create unique designs with their favorite emoji and color combinations.
Live Activities comes to iPadOS, allowing users to stay on top of things that are happening in real time right from the Lock Screen, such as a sports game, travel plans, or a food delivery order.
More Powerful Widgets
Widgets get interactive in iPadOS 17, allowing users to get tasks done with just a tap. For example, users can turn on the lights, play a song, or mark a reminder as complete in the moment, right from a widget. And with updates to WidgetKit, developers can build interactivity into their widgets.
Interactive widgets are now available on the Lock Screen and Home Screen, making it easy to take action and get helpful information at a glance. On the Lock Screen, widgets blend seamlessly with the wallpaper with adaptive tinting to optimize for legibility.
Working with PDFs Is Even Easier
Entering information in PDFs is now easier than ever. iPadOS 17 uses machine learning to identify fields in a PDF so that users can quickly add details, such as names, addresses, and emails from Contacts.
Notes Introduces a New PDF Experience
A big update to the Notes app gives users new ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs. In iPadOS 17, PDFs appear full width, making it easy to flip through pages, make a quick annotation, or sketch directly in the document with Apple Pencil.

Available from the keyboard, a new drawer gathers all of a user’s stickers in one place for easier access across iPadOS.
New Messages features include an expandable menu that appears with a simple tap for easy access to the user’s most frequently used iMessage apps. The search experience is improved with filters — including people, keywords, and content types — that allow more specificity in finding exactly what users are looking for. Users can now easily jump to their last-read message in an active group chat, and replying to a message inline is even simpler and quicker by swiping on a message bubble.
Audio messages are transcribed automatically so users can read them in the moment or listen later. When a user shares their location in Messages, it shows up live in the conversation until the sharing session is over.
More Expressive Ways to Communicate with FaceTime
In FaceTime, users can leave an audio or video message when someone doesn’t pick up the call.
FaceTime calls also get more expressive with Reactions, such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, laser beams, rain, and more. The new effects can be activated through simple gestures, and third-party video-calling apps can take advantage of them as well.
In an exciting update to Apple TV 4K, FaceTime now extends to the biggest screen in the home. Powered by Continuity Camera, users can initiate a video call directly from Apple TV, or start the call on iPad and then hand it off to Apple TV to see friends and family on their television. With Center Stage, users will have perfect framing even as they move around the room.
Safari Helps Users Be More Productive
Improvements to Safari allow users to be more productive than ever. With Profiles, users can keep their browsing separate between topics like work and personal. Each profile has their own history, cookies, Tab Groups, and Favorites, and it’s easy to switch between them.
Private Browsing now allows users to lock the window they’re viewing with Face ID or Touch ID, and removes trackers used for cross-site tracking. The search experience gets even better with increased responsiveness, more relevant search suggestions, and easier-to-read suggestions.
The Health App Comes to iPad
iPadOS 17 brings the Health app to iPad, giving users new ways to see their health data in rich detail. With an optimized design for the iPad display, Favorites has a new look, and users can receive insights into their health data with Trends, Highlights, and detailed interactive charts. Now, iPad users can also track and manage their medications, use Cycle Tracking, log their momentary emotions and daily moods, view their available health records from multiple institutions, and more — all in one central, secure, and private place.
Health and fitness developers can now use HealthKit on iPad, opening up new opportunities to create innovative experiences in their apps that incorporate data users choose to share, with rigorous privacy and data security protocols from the Health app.

M2 Ultra features 800GB/s of system memory bandwidth, far greater than anything found in a PC. And it can be configured with a massive 192GB of unified memory, which enables workflows not possible on a PC. For example, M2 Ultra can train massive machine learning workloads in a single system that the most powerful discrete GPU can’t even process.3
Advanced Custom Technologies Supercharge Machine Learning, Video, and More
M2 Ultra integrates Apple’s latest custom technologies right on the chip, maximizing performance and efficiency:
Better for the Environment
The power-efficient performance of M2 Ultra unlocks new possibilities for even the most demanding pro users without sacrificing environmental responsibility. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This also means that every chip Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.
Mac Transition to Apple Silicon Now Complete
With M2 Ultra powering the new Mac Pro, the Mac transition to Apple silicon is now complete, revolutionizing the laptop and desktop experience. Fueled by continued innovation in Apple silicon, it’s the beginning of a new era for the Mac.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces the 15‑inch MacBook Air
With an expansive 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, the performance of M2, up to 18 hours of battery life, and a six-speaker sound system, all in a thin and light, fanless design, the new MacBook Air is the world’s best 15-inch laptop
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introduced the 15-inchMacBook Air, the world’s best 15-inch laptop. With an expansive 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, the incredible performance of M2, up to 18 hours of battery life,1and a silent, fanless design, the new MacBook Air brings power and portability — all in the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop. With an all-new six-speaker sound system, the 15-inch MacBook Air delivers immersive Spatial Audio, along with a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, MagSafe charging, and the power and ease of macOS Ventura for an unrivaled experience. Customers can order starting today, with availability beginning Tuesday, June 13. The 13-inch MacBook Air with M2 gets a new starting price of $1,099 — $100 less than before — to deliver even more value and choice to everyone, from upgraders to first-time Mac customers.
“We’re thrilled to introduce the first 15-inch MacBook Air. With its incredible performance and striking design, the new MacBook Air is the world’s best 15-inch laptop. And it’s only possible with Apple silicon,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “From its expansive Liquid Retina display and remarkably thin and fanless design, to extraordinary battery life and an immersive six-speaker sound system, the new MacBook Air has it all.”
Brilliant 15.3-inch Liquid Retina Display
The new MacBook Air features a spacious, high-resolution 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, so users can see even more content. With up to 500 nits of brightness and support for 1 billion colors, the brilliant Liquid Retina display makes content look remarkably rich and vibrant, and text razor sharp. It is also twice the resolution and 25 percent brighter than a comparable PC laptop.2
World’s Thinnest 15-inch Laptop
The new MacBook Air measures only 11.5mm thin, making it the world’s thinnest 15-inch laptop. It weighs just 3.3 pounds, so it’s incredibly portable. Even with its expansive display, the new MacBook Air is solid and durable. And it is also nearly 40 percent thinner and half a pound lighter than a comparable PC laptop.2
MacBook Air also features MagSafe charging, two Thunderbolt ports for connecting accessories and up to a 6K external display, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack for versatile connectivity. It comes in four gorgeous finishes — midnight, starlight, space gray, and silver.
Blazing Performance and Tremendous Battery Life with M2
With the M2 chip, the 15-inch MacBook Air has incredible performance. It’s up to 12x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air.3When compared to the best-selling 15-inch PC laptop with a Core i7 processor, the new MacBook Air is up to twice as fast.4It also delivers extraordinary battery life, with up to 18 hours — 50 percent more than on the PC — even with a better display and better performance.5The 15-inch MacBook Air features a powerful 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, a 10-core GPU for blazing-fast graphics, and a 16-core Neural Engine. M2 also delivers 100GB/s of memory bandwidth and supports up to 24GB of fast unified memory, so multitasking and working with complex workloads is superfluid. The performance of M2 lets users work, play, or create just about anything — anywhere.
1080p FaceTime HD Camera and Six-Speaker Sound System
The 1080p FaceTime HD camera on MacBook Air is perfect for FaceTime calls and video conferencing. Combined with the processing power of the advanced image signal processor on M2, users will look great on video calls. A three-mic array captures clean audio using advanced beamforming algorithms, so users come through loud and clear on video calls.
The design of the new 15-inch MacBook Air also features a phenomenal new six-speaker sound system with two tweeters and two sets of force-cancelling woofers. The new speakers deliver twice the bass depth for fuller sound, and Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos provides immersive experiences whether listening to music or watching movies.
Powerful Productivity with macOS
macOS Ventura takes the Mac experience to a whole new level that helps users achieve even more. Messages and Mail are better than ever, while Safari — the world’s fastest browser on Mac — ushers in a passwordless future with passkeys. Continuity Camera brings video conferencing features to any Mac, including Desk View, Center Stage, and Studio Light. Stage Manager automatically organizes apps and windows, so users can concentrate on the task at hand and still see everything in a single glance. With iCloud Shared Photo Library, users can create and share a separate photo library among up to six family members, and the Freeform app provides a flexible canvas that enables users to be even more productive and expressive. Users can work effortlessly across Mac and iPhone with Continuity features like Handoff, AirDrop, Universal Clipboard, and Messages.
macOS Sonoma, coming this fall, makes the Mac experience more delightful and productive than ever, including new ways to personalize with widgets and stunning screen savers, an optimized gaming experience with Game Mode, powerful video conferencing capabilities, a big update to Safari, and more.
Better for the Environment
The new MacBook Air is designed with the environment in mind, now using 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards, and 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. MacBook Air also features 100 percent recycled cobalt in the MagSafe connector and 90 percent recycled steel in the battery tray. MacBook Air meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and is focused on its Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral. This means every Mac Apple creates, from design to manufacturing to customer use, will have net-zero climate impact.

June 14, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple’s Racial Equity and Justice Initiative surpasses $200 million in investments, doubling initial 2020 commitment
Apple is investing an additional $25 million in venture capital to expand support for minority businesses and address systemic barriers to funding access
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI), a long-term global effort to advance equity and expand opportunities for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous communities, has more than doubled its initial financial commitment to total more than $200 million over the last three years. Since launching REJI in June 2020, Apple has supported education, economic empowerment, and criminal justice reform work across the U.S., with recent expansion to Australia, the U.K., and Mexico.
Apple launched REJI at a pivotal moment in the U.S., as protests against racial injustice swept the nation. The initiative built upon the company’s years of work to create greater access to opportunity and advance equity for underserved groups, establishing a new entity dedicated to accelerating progress through deep engagements in schools and communities.
“Building a more just and equitable world is urgent work that demands collaboration, commitment, and a common sense of purpose,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We are proud to partner with many extraordinary organizations that are dedicated to addressing injustice and eliminating barriers to opportunity. And we’ll continue to lead with our values as we expand our efforts to create opportunities, lift up communities, and help build a better future for all.”
Through REJI’s education grants, Apple has reached more than 160,000 learners through in-person courses and out-of-school offerings, while committing over $50 million to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) to support science, technology, engineering, arts, and math opportunities. With a focus on economic empowerment, REJI funds financial institutions — including venture capital firms, Community Development Financial Institutions, and Minority Depository Institutions — that support Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous entrepreneurs and businesses. And REJI’s criminal justice reform grants have supported legal services, safe housing, identification services, healthcare access, and other vital reentry services for more than 19,000 justice-impacted individuals.
“We launched REJI at a critical inflection point for our country,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We are resolved to keep building on the progress we’ve made to ensure equitable opportunity for Black and Brown communities across America and around the world.”
New Partnership to Expand Access and Equity
As part of its expanding work, today Apple announced a new partnership with the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance (MBKA), a program of the Obama Foundation. Through this strategic partnership and funding, Apple aims to help close opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color by supporting training for community leaders and MBKA staff, expanding programming for boys and young men of color, and strengthening the MBKA network through targeted community impact microgrants. The program plans to train more than 500 leaders and engage over 50,000 youth across the U.S.
“Apple’s continued support of the My Brother’s Keeper Alliance empowers the foundation to develop and implement new initiatives that create opportunities for our young people,” said Valerie Jarrett, the Obama Foundation’s CEO. “Together, we are building a more inclusive educational system that nurtures creativity, fosters innovation, and transforms the lives of boys and young men of color across the country. We are grateful for their partnership and look forward to our continued collective efforts to ensure all youth can reach their full potential.”
Increasing Investments in Minority Businesses
Apple today committed an additional $25 million to Collab Capital, Harlem Capital, and VamosVentures — three venture capital funds working with minority-owned businesses. With this new round of investments, Apple has committed $50 million in venture capital support and more than $100 million in overall financing to mission-aligned diverse businesses and financial institutions. These investments are part of REJI’s economic empowerment pillar aimed at addressing systemic barriers to access, creating opportunity, and supplying funding to support underrepresented and underresourced communities and businesses of color.
Advancing Opportunities Globally
Building on its ongoing work in the U.S., REJI has continued to expand globally. Today, Apple announced new programming in New Zealand in partnership with Te Pūkenga — New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology, the country’s largest vocational educator. This work will support efforts to equip educators with the skills they need to prepare underrepresented Māori and Pasifika students to enter the country’s growing technology sector.
In Australia, Apple announced REJI’s expansion in August 2022 with initial grant funding to support initiatives and nonprofits serving Indigenous communities, including Deadly Connections, ID. Know Yourself, First Australians Capital, Art Gallery of NSW’s Djamu Youth Justice program, and Original Power. New funding will support Karrkad Kanjdji Trust, a charitable trust established by the Traditional Owners of Warddeken and Djelk Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) to achieve their vision for a healthy country. Through REJI and Apple’s environmental justice grants, the company is also supporting the Women Rangers program with funding to enhance its diverse portfolio of land management, leadership, and skill-building activities.
In the U.K., Apple partnered with the Southbank Centre to launch Reframe: The Residency, a program designed to reduce the barriers that exist for aspiring Black creatives. In May, the program’s first cohort was selected from London, Birmingham, and Manchester. Artists will present their work at a free exhibition, which opens on Tuesday, July 18, at the Southbank Centre. Also a part of Reframe, Inspire Schools works with educational institutions to teach students new skills by making digital magazines focused on the climate crisis.
Continuing Apple’s Community Education Initiative work with universities across Mexico, REJI has partnered with Enactus to support the expansion of iOS Development Labs that teach coding with Swift and prepare learners for careers in Mexico’s thriving iOS app economy. And with the two newest labs in Tijuana and Chiapas, REJI is helping create new opportunities for traditionally underserved communities.
Spotlighting Impact
Today, Apple released its first-everREJI Impact Overview, which provides a snapshot of the initiative’s impact across its areas of focus. The company continues to identify new partners and new avenues to advance its mission. In the three years since Apple launched REJI, the programs and organizations the initiative supports have continued to make a tangible impact in communities around the world. The following represent REJI’s three priority focus areas:
Education
Building on its longstanding work with minority-serving institutions, Apple is a founding partner of Propel, a global HBCU technology and innovation hub. This summer, Propel will introduce Propel Learn, a new platform that provides experiential learning experiences, career opportunities, and microcredentials — all developed specifically for and by the HBCU community.
Apple’s New Silicon Initiative at HBCUs across the country helps prepare students for careers in the growing fields of hardware technology, computer architecture, and silicon chip design. Grants awarded to Alabama A&M University, Howard University, Morgan State University, and Prairie View A&M University are designed to support engineering programs as they develop their curricula in partnership with Apple experts.
Launched with an investment from Apple, the Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub at California State University, Northridge (CSUN) aims to equip Hispanic/Latinx and other historically underserved students with high-demand skills in science, technology, engineering, and math. In collaboration with other California State University campuses and HSIs across the country, the hub accelerates educational equity while equipping students to succeed.
Economic Empowerment
Through a partnership with fintech company CNote, Apple helps fund mission-driven banks and credit unions that serve low- to moderate-income people, and Black and Brown communities. CNote facilitates cash deposits that help fuel affordable housing and small business loans, and provide a just alternative to predatory lending.
Apple’s Impact Accelerator expands access to opportunity for Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous environmental solution and service providers. The 12-week capacity-building program helps participants reach their next stage of development and scale their impact.
Apple Entrepreneur Camp supports underrepresented founders and developers with app-driven businesses as they build the next generation of cutting-edge apps. In addition to attending hands-on technology labs and getting one-on-one code-level guidance from Apple, participating Hispanic/Latinx, Black, and female founders and developers become a part of a global network that encourages the pipeline and longevity of these entrepreneurs in technology.
Criminal Justice Reform
To combat systemic racism, REJI is working to address deep disparities in criminal justice that disproportionately impact Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and Indigenous communities. Apple has partnered with several community colleges — including the Los Angeles Community College District, Delgado Community College in New Orleans, and Houston Community College — to implement programs to help incarcerated and paroled individuals learn new skills, prevent recidivism, and create economic opportunity for parolees and probationers.
Apple has also made meaningful contributions to various nonprofit organizations that advance equity and justice, including the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, Defy Ventures, Vera Institute of Justice, and The Last Mile.
Taking Action Across Apple
Ensuring that racial equity and justice is reflected across Apple, the company partners with local communities to drive impact and achieve meaningful change:

Apple Battersea has highly skilled and deeply knowledgeable team members who are ready to deliver best-in-class service to customers who want to purchase and learn more about the latest Apple products, including the all-new 15-inch MacBook Air — the world’s best 15-inch laptop — and Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra.

For anyone interested in learning alongside family, friends, and colleagues, Group Booking is also available for Today at Apple sessions in the store or online.
Apple Battersea is built with universal design principles that create an inviting and accessible space for everyone who comes through its doors. The new store offers varied table and seating heights, expanded assisted listening systems, and enhanced visual and acoustic clarity as well as access routes that give wheelchair users more space to navigate.
Customers can explore products and services on the newly designed avenues engineered for carbon sequestration through the use of sustainably harvested wood. And, like all Apple Store locations, Battersea is operationally carbon neutral and runs on 100 percent renewable energy.

PRESS RELEASE
Developer tools to create spatial experiences for Apple Vision Pro now available
The visionOS software development kit (SDK) enables Apple’s developer community to bring their apps to life in ways never before possible
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the availability of new software tools and technologies that enable developers to create groundbreaking app experiences forApple Vision Pro— Apple’s first spatial computer. Featuring visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating system, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in their physical space using the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — their eyes, hands, and voice. Starting today, Apple’s global community of developers will be able to create an entirely new class of spatial computing apps that take full advantage of the infinite canvas in Vision Pro and seamlessly blend digital content with the physical world to enable extraordinary new experiences. With the visionOS SDK, developers can utilize the powerful and unique capabilities of Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences across a variety of categories including productivity, design, gaming, and more.
Next month, Apple will open developer labs in Cupertino, London, Munich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo to provide developers with hands-on experience to test their apps on Apple Vision Pro hardware and get support from Apple engineers. Development teams will also be able to apply for developer kits to help them quickly build, iterate, and test right on Apple Vision Pro.
“Apple Vision Pro redefines what’s possible on a computing platform. Developers can get started building visionOS apps using the powerful frameworks they already know, and take their development even further with new innovative tools and technologies like Reality Composer Pro, to design all-new experiences for their users,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “By taking advantage of the space around the user, spatial computing unlocks new opportunities for our developers, and enables them to imagine new ways to help their users connect, be productive, and enjoy new types of entertainment. We can’t wait to see what our developer community dreams up.”
Developers can build new experiences that take advantage of the groundbreaking features of Apple Vision Pro by using the same foundational frameworks they already know from other Apple platforms, including powerful technologies like Xcode, SwiftUI, RealityKit, ARKit, and TestFlight. These tools enable developers to create new types of apps that span a spectrum of immersion, including windows, which have depth and can showcase 3D content; volumes, which create experiences that are viewable from any angle; and spaces, which can fully immerse a user in an environment with unbounded 3D content. To help developers optimize 3D content for their visionOS apps and games, an all-new tool available with Xcode called Reality Composer Pro lets them preview and prepare 3D models, animations, images, and sounds, so they look amazing on Vision Pro. Developers can also interact with their apps in the new visionOS simulator to explore and test various room layouts and lighting conditions. And every developer framework comes with built-in support for Apple’s innovative accessibility features to ensure spatial computing and visionOS apps are accessible to everyone.
Starting next month, developers who have been building 3D apps and games with Unity’s robust authoring tools can port their Unity apps to Apple Vision Pro and take full advantage of its powerful capabilities.
Developers who have previewed the visionOS SDK and APIs are excited for the potential of the platform and how it will enable them to create all-new app experiences for their users:
“With Apple Vision Pro,Complete HeartXwill help prepare medical students for clinical practice by using hyper-realistic 3D models and animations that help them understand and visualize medical issues, such as ventricular fibrillation, and how to apply their knowledge with patients,” said Jan Herzhoff, Elsevier Health’s president. “Learning through Complete HeartX on Apple Vision Pro will transform medical education and prepare future health professionals for practice.”
“Thedjayapp on Apple Vision Pro puts a fully featured DJ system right at a user’s fingertips. With a reimagined spatial interface, anyone can mix their favorite music and apply real-time effects using just their eyes and hands,” said Karim Morsy, Algoriddim’s CEO. “Whether for a beginner or a seasoned professional, djay on Vision Pro transforms the user’s surroundings with stunning environments that automatically react to their mix, enabling them to experience and interact with music in ways never before possible.”
“JigSpaceand Apple Vision Pro empower people and businesses to easily communicate their ideas or products in all-new ways,” said Zac Duff, JigSpace’s cofounder and CEO. “It uses the high-resolution CAD files companies already have, so their marketing, sales, product, or support teams can securely collaborate with colleagues or customers from anywhere in the world and get people to that ‘Aha!’ moment in a fraction of the time it usually takes. This level of fast, effective communication simply wasn’t possible before.”
“Manufacturers can use AR solutions fromPTCto collaborate on critical business problems by bringing interactive 3D content into the real world — from a single product, to an entire production line,” said Stephen Prideaux-Ghee, PTC’s chief technology officer of AR/VR. “With Apple Vision Pro, stakeholders across departments and in different locations can review content simultaneously to make design and operation decisions. This capability will unlock a level of collaboration previously not possible.”
The visionOS SDK, updated Xcode, Simulator, and Reality Composer Pro are available for Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.com. Registered Apple developers have access to a variety of resources to help them design, develop, and test apps for Apple Vision Pro, including extensive technical documentation, new design kits, and updated human interface guidelines for visionOS.
To learn more about designing new app experiences for Apple Vision Pro, or to apply for a developer kit starting next month, developers can visitdeveloper.apple.com/visionos.

New immersive AR experience brings student creativity to life
Australian artists create a new immersive educational experience, inspiring global cocreation and connection to the environment, powered by iPad Pro and Apple Pencil
Inspired by a curiosity for the natural world,Deep Fieldis a new immersive art experience and app created by celebrated Australian artists and creative technologists Tin Nguyen and Edward Cutting of Tin&Ed, using iPad Pro and Apple Pencil. Initially available at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney and the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the interactive augmented reality (AR) and sonic experience enables students and families around the world to cocreate and connect in real time through their shared reimagining of the environment.
Harnessing the power and portability of iPad Pro, combined with the precision of Apple Pencil to foster creativity,Deep Fieldparticipants are invited to take inspiration from works of art and the environment to draw their own flora and fauna, experimenting with vibrant color, shapes, and textures. After dreaming up fantastical plant parts, participants sketch their designs with Apple Pencil in the Deep Field iPad app, which are then added to a global database filled with flora drawn by participants across the world in real time, cocreating a new ecosystem where the invisible worlds of plants are revealed through the magic of AR. Using the LiDAR Scanner on iPad Pro, participants watch their artworks bloom into spectacular 3D plant structures trailing across the floors, walls, and ceilings around them, creating a newly imagined, immersive natural world.
The guided experience encourages audiences to consider new perspectives and think about the planet differently, from plants that have lived for a thousand years, to new and imagined species. Taking the experience to another level, the app’s UV mode also enables students and families to view their newly created world in a different dimension, as they experience the world as a pollinator.
Multidisciplinary artists Tin&Ed create vibrant, playful, and interactive experiences across the world that explore and push the interconnected boundaries between art, design, and technology, and the physical and digital worlds. More than an immersive simulation,Deep Fieldutilizes accessible technology that empowers people to bring creativity to life, while also shining a spotlight on the need to protect the planet.
To bring theDeep Fieldexperienceto life at this scale, Tin&Ed fused their background in art and design and passion for creative technologies to work skillfully across multiple devices. The power of MacBook Pro, Mac Studio with M1 Ultra, and Studio Display, combined with 3D platform Unity, enabled the development of complex three-dimensional worlds that were then optimized for real time. The Deep Field app was designed using Apple’s ARKit framework, allowing for the integration of the depth-sensing features in iPad Pro with the M2 chip, to produce spectacular 3D plant structures in AR. The state-of-the-art LiDAR Scanner in iPad Pro offers cutting-edge depth-sensing capabilities to measure light distance, and uses pixel depth information of a scene to deliver faster and more realistic AR experiences.
“For us, AR is a powerful artistic medium for storytelling because it is immersive and multisensory,” says Tin Nguyen, artist at Tin&Ed. “The power of the M2 chip on iPad Pro has made it possible to create a work that enables children from across the globe to imagine new worlds together in real time.”
“Deep Fieldencourages children to look, listen, and think more deeply about the natural world and their place within it,” says Edward Cutting, artist at Tin&Ed. “We hope they come away from the experience feeling a sense of wonder and curiosity and a deeper connection to nature and each other.”
To enhance the multisensory experience,Deep Fieldfeatures a multichannel soundscape of forgotten and extinct species by celebrated audio naturalist Martyn Stewart, bringing a new appreciation to the beauty of the noisy environment of the natural world. Stewart, together with his foundation, The Listening Planet, has made it his life’s work to catalog the sounds of the planet and bring nature’s voice to the world in the hopes of safeguarding its future.
Deep Fieldis now available for students and families at the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, and will be available for visitors at the Getty Center in Los Angeles from Saturday, July 8, until Sunday, July 16.
“Deep Fieldis a new opportunity for our youngest visitors to experience the intersection of art and technology,” says Dr. Michael Brand, the Art Gallery of New South Wales’s director. “Thanks to the vision of Tin&Ed, with the experience starting in our Yiribana Gallery, each participant will be invited to look closely at nature through the lens of the world’s oldest continuous cultures, as depicted in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander artworks. Children will also be encouraged to connect with their surroundings by observing and responding to the magnificent natural landscape, which is seamlessly integrated into our new art museum campus in Sydney on Gadigal Country.”
“This is the Getty’s second collaboration with Tin&Ed, following the iOS app they created for our William Blake exhibition,” says Timothy Potts, Maria Hummer-Tuttle and Robert Tuttle director of the J. Paul Getty Museum. “Deep Fieldallows visitors to take inspiration from works of art in the Getty’s collection, including our own Central Garden (a living work of art), and collaborate with people on the other side of the world to create an ever-changing interactive work of art in augmented reality. In addition to bridging traditional art with new technology, it serves as a gentle reminder that we share this one earth with others and need to work as a team to care for it.”
Following availability in Sydney and Los Angeles, theDeep Fieldexperience will embark on a world tour, arriving in Europe in October, and then on to Asia in November, including a stop at ArtScience Museum in Singapore.

Ingrid Granados, Destination: Home’s initiatives officer

Apple partnerships help more than 40,000 Californians access affordable housing and resources
In 2021, as so many communities continued to grapple with the financial effects of the pandemic, Fernando Cortes struggled to find work and pay his bills. A friend told him that Destination: Home, a nonprofit focused on the unhoused and supported in part by Apple, could help defray the cost of his rental payments as part of its Homelessness Prevention System.
“I wouldn’t have been able to continue living in my home without that support,” says Cortes, who lives in Sunnyvale, California, with his 10-year-old son. “I think it’s really important for people to know that there are organizations like this where they can go to get help.”
What the 43-year-old didn’t expect was to be invited to join an advisory board designed to help improve the organization’s Homelessness Prevention System process for other people who have experienced or are at risk of losing their housing.
“Even though things are going much better now and I’m not in that situation anymore, it means a lot to be able to give back,” says Cortes. “I want to make sure other people know that when they go get help, there’s somebody there listening to them and working to improve things.”
Apple has partnered with Destination: Home, as well as California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), and Housing Trust Silicon Valley as part of its $2.5 billion commitment to address the housing crisis across California.
The company has also teamed up with United Way of Greater Los Angeles to fund the Affordable Housing Initiative, a social impact fund that supports the creation of affordable housing for individuals and families who are unhoused or at risk of falling into homelessness.
Given the complexity of the affordable housing crisis, Apple has worked with community partners to identify a diverse array of programs and projects that approach the challenge in distinct ways. Apple has now deployed nearly $1.5 billion to support affordable housing across the state, including the construction of thousands of units of new housing, programs to support vulnerable populations, assistance for thousands of first-time homeowners, and an innovative bond recycling program to finance new developments.
Cortes and his son are among more than 40,000 Californians who are receiving housing support through the projects and programs Apple has helped fund. Apple-supported projects are creating new homes for close to 20,000 individuals, and another nearly 24,000 people who were at risk of losing their homes have been able to stay housed.
“We are proud to be working side by side with organizations across the state to help ensure communities and families here can thrive,” said Kristina Raspe, Apple’s vice president for Global Real Estate and Facilities. “Our partnerships have helped many across the community move into new homes, and are helping keep many more families in housing.”
One tenet of the company’s statewide housing initiative is the CalHFA Bond Recycling Program, which was launched with Apple’s support. The unique program creates an additional avenue of financing to help fund affordable housing developments, and has allowed CalHFA to access hundreds of millions of dollars in otherwise unavailable affordable housing funding, multiplying the scale of Apple’s commitment to the program.
Linda Smith and her husband moved into one of those developments, Cedar Grove Apartments in Santa Rosa, California, after their home of 28 years was foreclosed on.
“I’m really happy — I feel blessed that we got into this new apartment,” says Smith, 75. “The people at Cedar Grove have just been so beautiful to work with. They kept us posted so we could get in quickly — we ended up being one of the first people to move in once it was built.”
The timing couldn’t have been more critical, as Smith’s husband was facing health issues and they had already been forced to leave the home they shared with numerous family members. Shortly after they moved into Cedar Grove in October, Smith’s daughter and granddaughter relocated to the area as well.
“I’ve gotten involved here — I started the community garden with my granddaughter, who I babysit,” says Smith. “When we’re out there working on it, all the kids gather around and get excited. I hurt my leg a few weeks ago and couldn’t get out to water it, and my neighbors noticed and have been watering it for me — I didn’t have to ask; they just started helping.”
Cedar Grove is one of 22 developments that are providing thousands of units of affordable housing through the CalHFA Bond Recycling Program, including numerous new projects under construction and others that are using the funding to rehabilitate aging units for new tenants. In partnership with CalHFA, Apple has also provided mortgage and down payment assistance to thousands of low- and moderate-income first-time homebuyers.
Housing Trust Silicon Valley and Apple’s public-private partnership has helped fund the creation of more than 1,000 new homes. Two of these buildings are currently in operation, five developments have been completed or are nearly complete, and six developments are under construction. That includes The Kelsey in San Francisco, a fully accessible, disability-forward apartment building that will house a ground-level commercial space for green businesses that employ people of all abilities, incomes, and backgrounds.
Over the past several years, Destination: Home has continued to expand its Homelessness Prevention System with Apple’s support, providing direct financial assistance to nearly 24,000 people, including Fernando Cortes and his son. Funds from Apple have also enabled Destination: Home to help create several thousand new supportive and extremely low-income homes in the Bay Area, and increased access to technology equipment and free high-speed internet for hundreds of low-income residents.
Ingrid Granados, an initiatives officer with Destination: Home, has helped connect countless families in her community to the wide array of resources the nonprofit can make available to people.
“We know that if people don’t stay housed, everything worsens, right? Their outcomes, the cost on society, the kids’ educational impact — all of it,” she says. “The federal money our organization received had to go to help people pay rent, but we knew that was only one part of the equation. Apple really allowed us to have flexible funding for not only rental assistance, but other necessities to help families meet their individual needs.”
Granados approaches each person with a level of understanding born out of shared experience — three years ago she was on the brink of homelessness.
“I remember my caseworker giving me a hug at Christmas and telling me, ‘Come and get food — do not feel shame,’” she says.
Granados has known Fernando Cortes since he first reached out to Destination: Home. He’s thankful to her and the organization for not just helping him with rental assistance, but also connecting him with resources that have had a huge impact on his life and the life of his son.
“I took a parenting class, and one of the tasks was to construct a heart, so I made a heart pillow for him,” says Cortes. “I think that he understands on some level that we have been helped by others — and I’m reminded of the difference it’s made when I see the pillow he still sleeps with to this day.”

August 1, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Pixar, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, and NVIDIA form Alliance for OpenUSD to drive open standards for 3D content
Alliance to foster global collaboration for Universal Scene Description (USD)
SAN FRANCISCOPixar,Adobe,Apple,Autodesk, andNVIDIA, together with theJoint Development Foundation(JDF), an affiliate of the Linux Foundation, today announced the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD) to promote the standardization, development, evolution, and growth of Pixar’s Universal Scene Description technology.
The alliance seeks to standardize the 3D ecosystem by advancing the capabilities of Open Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD). By promoting greater interoperability of 3D tools and data, the alliance will enable developers and content creators to describe, compose, and simulate large-scale 3D projects and build an ever-widening range of 3D-enabled products and services.
Created by Pixar Animation Studios, OpenUSD is a high-performance 3D scene description technology that offers robust interoperability across tools, data, and workflows. Already known for its ability to collaboratively capture artistic expression and streamline cinematic content production, OpenUSD’s power and flexibility make it an ideal content platform to embrace the needs of new industries and applications.
The alliance will develop written specifications detailing the features of OpenUSD. This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications. The Linux Foundation’s JDF was chosen to house the project, as it will enable open, efficient, and effective development of OpenUSD specifications, while providing a path to recognition through the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
AOUSD will also provide the primary forum for the collaborative definition of enhancements to the technology by the greater industry. The alliance invites a broad range of companies and organizations to join and participate in shaping the future of OpenUSD.
“Universal Scene Description was invented at Pixar and is the technological foundation of our state-of-the-art animation pipeline,” said Steve May, Chief Technology Officer at Pixar and Chairperson of AOUSD. “OpenUSD is based on years of research and application in Pixar filmmaking. We open-sourced the project in 2016, and the influence of OpenUSD now expands beyond film, visual effects, and animation and into other industries that increasingly rely on 3D data for media interchange. With the announcement of AOUSD, we signal the exciting next step: the continued evolution of OpenUSD as a technology and its position as an international standard.”
“At Adobe, we believe in providing artists a set of flexible and powerful solutions running on a variety of devices,” said Guido Quaroni, Senior Director of Engineering, 3D&I at Adobe. “Leveraging a common 3D data representation during the creative process multiplies the value brought by each package and device. OpenUSD was created to be one of these ‘multipliers’ and we are excited to see a diverse group of companies joining together to support this innovative and open technology.”
“OpenUSD will help accelerate the next generation of AR experiences, from artistic creation to content delivery, and produce an ever-widening array of spatial computing applications,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Vision Products Group. “Apple has been an active contributor to the development of USD, and it is an essential technology for the groundbreaking visionOS platform, as well as the new Reality Composer Pro developer tool. We look forward to fostering its growth into a broadly adopted standard.”
“Whether you’re building CG worlds or digital twins or looking ahead to the 3D web, content creators need a cohesive way to collaborate and share data across tools, services, and platforms,” said Gordon Bradley, Fellow, Media & Entertainment, Autodesk. “Autodesk is excited to support the Alliance for OpenUSD as it drives 3D interoperability for visual effects, animation, and beyond, and supports our vision to help customers design and make a better world.”
“OpenUSD gives 3D developers, artists, and designers the complete foundation to tackle large-scale industrial, digital content creation, and simulation workloads with broad multi-app interoperability,” said Guy Martin, Director of Open Source and Standards at NVIDIA. “This alliance is a unique opportunity to accelerate OpenUSD collaboration globally by building formal standards across industries and initiatives to realize 3D worlds and industrial digitalization.”
AOUSD steering committee members will be speaking at both the Academy Software Foundation’s Open Source Days on Aug. 6 and at the SIGGRAPH conference at theAutodesk Vision Serieson Aug. 8 at 1 p.m. PT in Room 404A.

UPDATE
Apple Card’s Savings account by Goldman Sachs reaches over $10 billion in deposits
Today, Apple announced that Apple Card’s high-yield Savings account offered by Goldman Sachs has reached over $10 billion in deposits from users since launching in April.1Savings enables Apple Card users to grow their Daily Cash rewards with a Savings account from Goldman Sachs, which offers a high-yield APY of 4.15 percent.2
“With each of the financial products we’ve introduced, we’ve sought to reinvent the category with our users’ financial health in mind. That was our goal with the launch of Apple Card four years ago, and it remained our guiding principle with the launch of Savings,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “With no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements, Savings provides an easy way for users to save money every day, and we’re thrilled to see the excellent reception from customers both new and existing.”
Since the launch of Savings, 97 percent of Savings customers have chosen to have their Daily Cash automatically deposited into their account, enabling users to easily establish and continue cultivating healthy savings habits. There is no limit on how much Daily Cash users can earn, and to build on their savings even further, users can deposit additional funds into their Savings account through a linked bank account, or from their Apple Cash balance.3
The Savings account from Goldman Sachs builds on the financial health benefits that the award-winning Apple Card already offers. Built into Wallet on iPhone, Apple Card has transformed the credit card experience by simplifying the application process, eliminating all fees,4encouraging users to pay less interest, providing the privacy and security users expect from Apple, and offering Daily Cash on every purchase.
“We are very pleased with the success of the Savings account as we continue to deliver seamless, valuable products to Apple Card customers, with a shared focus on creating a best-in-class customer experience that helps consumers lead healthier financial lives,” said Liz Martin, Goldman Sachs’s head of Enterprise Partnerships.
Users can easily set up and manage their Savings account directly from Apple Card in Wallet. To get started, after accessing Apple Card from the Wallet app, users can tap More, select Daily Cash, tap Set Up Savings, and follow the onscreen instructions.
Once set up, users will also have access to an easy-to-use Savings dashboard in Wallet where they can conveniently track their account balance and interest earned over time. Additionally, they can withdraw funds through the Savings dashboard by transferring them to a linked bank account or to their Apple Cash account.5

And it’s easy to because you see them every day. But we need to start treating them with more respect the way they treat us with care.

UPDATE
A new generation preserves tribal land and culture in America’s national parks
The National Park Foundation, an Apple partner, funds Yosemite Ancestral Stewards and Ancestral Lands Conservation Corps work to restore a sacred black oak grove in El Capitan Meadow
At the base of Yosemite National Park’s 7,573-foot-tall El Capitan lies a grove of black oak trees. As the wind blows, their leaves rustle like whispers to each other. Meanwhile, passersby stumble off the beaten path, seeking an up-close view of El Capitan’s pure granite rock face. These wanderers create social trails, as they’re called, which occur when park visitors repeatedly veer off planned routes and follow trotted-down footpaths through meadows and other grasslands. They’re one of many threats to this black oak grove that is sacred to the seven traditionally associated tribes and communities of Yosemite: the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation, the Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians, the Bishop Paiute Tribe, Bridgeport Indian Colony, Kutzadika’a Mono Lake Indian Community, North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians of California, and the Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians.
“It takes a very long time for those things to come back,” Nellie Tucker, crew leader for this season’s Yosemite Ancestral Stewards program (YAS) — who is also Southern Sierra Miwuk and Paiute — explains about social trails. “That’s one less blade of grass that a butterfly can land on, or something can eat. And then it becomes another space for invasive plants.”
This summer, the black oak grove in El Capitan Meadow is being restored by YAS alongside the Ancestral Lands Conservation Corps (ALCC), a group of Indigenous youth passionate about protecting the land and culture of their tribes and seeing nature returned to its original abundance and beauty. The YAS program, funded in part by the National Park Foundation’s Service Corps program and Yosemite Conservancy, is the first tribal conservation crew made up of young adults from the Yosemite National Park-affiliated tribes.
Since 2017, Apple customers have been able to support programs like this one through an Apple Pay campaign celebrating the National Park Service’s anniversary.
YAS and the ALCC are conducting fuels reduction work at El Capitan Meadow: felling dead trees and clearing downed limbs, dry brush, and other debris that could act as fuel for a wildfire should the area be struck by lightning or ignited in some other way. The crew’s work is guided by the teachings of tribal elders who hope to pass on their knowledge of caring for the land. Their efforts will culminate in a cultural burn of the debris, a tradition of using prescribed fire to maintain the health of land and vegetation that dates back thousands of years.
“Back in the day, to regulate how much leaf litter or invasive species were on the ground, Indigenous people would come in and plan out where they would burn and how they would do it,” says Nicole Long, a YAS crew member who is also part of the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation. “So they help the black oaks thrive because they’re a very resilient tree, just like all oaks, and they need the smoke and the fire to help reproduce, to help germinate, and to get rid of competition plants that can kill them.”
For generations, Indigenous people were cut out of the process of caring for this land. Forced removal has left these communities and their tribal lands in a state of flux, with national parks and protected areas benefitting from federal funds while tribes have been relocated, in many instances, beyond those park boundaries. From the 1800s right up to the 1970s, in the area that now constitutes Yosemite, many Indigenous families were forced onto reservations, their homes destroyed and their children forced to assimilate after being shipped off to boarding schools. The ramifications of that displacement and erasure of culture are still felt today: Unemployment among Indigenous people skyrocketed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to 28.6 percent. As of January 2022, that number has come down to 11.1 percent, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment data analyzed by the Brookings Institution.1
Here in Yosemite, the Ancestral Stewards program is an attempt to introduce a new generation of the original caretakers to the land, while creating pathways to employment and career opportunities for Indigenous youth.
For Tucker and Long, who grew up in Mariposa County just outside the park’s boundaries, their passion for land conservation followed them into adulthood after participating in the tribes’ weeklong traditional walk from Yosemite to Mono Lake. The walk follows the routes the tribes used to trade resources, such as acorns produced from black oaks like those in El Capitan Meadow. Long participated when she was 12 and discovered a love for both nature and hiking. Tucker also participated in her youth, taking in the connection to all the tribes as well as the beauty of the backcountry as a roadmap for what the park used to be and could be like again.
“It’s a little bit more untouched,” Tucker says. “This is what the valley used to look like, and I want to see the valley come back to that a little bit. I don't think it'll ever truly be the same, but just to give it a little bit more of that feel.”
Tucker got her start in land conservation work as an intern with the ALCC. She wanted to learn what crew life looked like, how to recruit young people, and how to build the foundation for a youth crew in her hometown before moving over to Yosemite Ancestral Stewards to get more hands-on experience with work crews. This season, the ALCC brought together an all-women crew. Tucker’s ALCC internship and status as protégé of National Park Service cultural ecologist Irene Vasquez, who she grew up going on the traditional walks alongside, placed her in exactly the right spot to help bring this program to life.
“It started out just with a vision,” Tucker recalls. “To have Native youth reconnect with the land, work that our ancestors did, and getting full-time jobs within the park boundaries, and just finding their way back to their home place.”
“We’re doing that through stewardship of the black oaks because they are an abundant resource and a huge connective cultural resource to our elders and to, hopefully now at least, a handful more of our youth,” she continues. “We started out collecting acorns here in this grove in El Capitan, and then those saplings were shipped off and we’re able to plant them. Now we’re just trying to clear space for those babies to grow and continue on that type of work.”
El Capitan is just one meadow in the almost 750,000 acres that comprise Yosemite National Park. And according to the National Park Foundation, America’s National Park System encompasses more than 85 million acres, many of which sit on tribal land and are under threat from the increasing negative impacts of climate change. The Oak Fire of 2022, which destroyed nearly 20,000 acres in Mariposa — many of which housed Indigenous tribes — as well as this season’s Pika Fire, carried smoke and flames within the park’s boundaries. Both incidents were stark reminders of the ongoing threat of wildfire. To mitigate climate change impact on Earth's natural resources, it's going to take multiple solutions — from multiple voices. And as Long describes, it also takes everyone understanding the original stewards' connection to the land to save it.
“We have an intertwined relationship that we take advantage of because the planet provides so much for us,” Long explains. “Plants provide food, the soil provides nutrients for the plants to grow and to feed us. Soil can also have other purposes, like medicine. There’s a lot of medicine microbes found in the soil that benefit us. Trees give us oxygen, they store carbon. They do so many things for us that we overlook. And it’s easy to because you see them every day. But we need to start treating them with more respect the way they treat us with care.”
ALCC crew lead Gabrielle Draper, who is Zuni and Diné, grew up learning Zuni traditions, stories, and prayers from her grandfather and father, knowing that one day she’d carry the responsibility of sharing those learnings with others.
“My grandpa always told me if I ever feel like I’m heavy-hearted, or I got things that I don’t want to talk out with people, I can always go out and pray to plants, to bugs — especially ants,” Draper remembers. “He always told me they’re strong, even though they’re small. He always told me that going outside is a good outlet to go and heal yourself because the earth has its own energy and ways to heal people.”
“The majority of these national parks are very connected to not only my community, but all of these other Indigenous communities, because there’s places that are considered to be shrines — there’s petroglyphs and pictographs,” Draper continues. “To me, those are very important because if they’re all wiped away, all of those prayers are going to be wiped away.”
For Draper and the other Indigenous members of the crew, the stakes are higher than protecting national parkland — they’re also preserving history and building a foundation for their future.

2023-09-12,Decrease,Apple unveils its first carbon neutral products,"Text of this article
September 12, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple unveils its first carbon neutral products
The new Apple Watch lineup marks major progress toward ambitious Apple 2030 climate goal
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced its first-ever carbon neutral products in the all-newApple Watch lineup. Innovations in design and clean energy have driven dramatic reductions in product emissions of over 75 percent for each carbon neutral Apple Watch.1This milestone marks a major step in the company’s journey toward its ambitious Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral by the end of the decade, including the entire global supply chain and the lifetime use of every device Apple makes.
As part of Apple 2030 and the company’s broader environmental efforts, Apple has also ended the use of leather across all of its product lines, announced its first entirely fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch lineup,2and continued to expand the use of recycled materials in iPhone. The company also introduced a new tool in the Home app called Grid Forecast,3which helps inform users when their power grid has cleaner energy available, so they can decide when to use electricity.
“At Apple, we have a longstanding and proven commitment to leading the fight against climate change. Our focus on renewable energy and low-carbon design has already driven industry-leading emissions reductions, and we’re not slowing down,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’ve achieved an important milestone in making the world’s most popular watch carbon neutral — and we will keep innovating to meet the urgency of the moment.”
Every Product Carbon Neutral by 2030
Apple has adopted a clear and rigorous approach to product decarbonization that prioritizes reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the three biggest sources across the product life cycle: electricity, materials, and transportation. Only after Apple steeply cuts product emissions, will the company apply high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects for emissions that cannot yet be avoided or reduced with existing solutions.
Each carbon neutral Apple Watch model meets the following strict criteria: 100 percent clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30 percent recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50 percent of shipping without the use of air transportation.4These combined efforts result in at least a 75 percent reduction in product emissions for each model. The company will use high-quality carbon credits to address the small amount of remaining emissions, resulting in a carbon neutral product footprint. Every carbon neutral Apple Watch — which includes any aluminum Series 9 and SE models when paired with a new Sport Loop, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop — is certified by SCS Global Services, a leader in environmental standards and certification.
The Path to 2030
Apple’s first carbon neutral products are the result of years of significant work and innovation across the company and its global supply chain. They also represent the latest step on a journey that began over a decade ago.
In 2020, Apple achieved carbon neutrality for its global corporate operations and announced Apple 2030: a bold strategy to be carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. Apple’s plan centers on an aggressive 75 percent reduction in overall carbon emissions from 2015 levels. By avoiding activities that generate carbon, significantly expanding renewable energy across the company’s corporate operations and supply chain, and designing with recycled and renewable materials, Apple has so far reduced total emissions by over 45 percent since 2015, while still growing revenue by over 65 percent in the same period.
As Apple accelerates efforts to decarbonize its value chain, every product represents an opportunity to reduce emissions — from the electricity used for manufacturing and charging devices, to materials and shipping.
Spurring Progress in Clean Electricity
All manufacturing for the carbon neutral Apple Watch models is powered by 100 percent clean electricity through investments and sourcing by Apple and its suppliers. Additionally, every supplier that manufactures parts and components for these models has committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for all of their Apple production by the end of the decade. Apple also works with manufacturing partners around the world to advocate for policies that support wider deployment of clean energy solutions.
Apple began building and investing in large-scale solar and wind farms to power its data centers and offices over a decade ago. In 2015, the company started working with its manufacturing partners to help them create and invest in their own solar and wind projects, and source renewable energy for all Apple production. Since 2018, all of Apple’s corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores worldwide have been powered by renewable electricity.
Thanks to these combined efforts, Apple and its global suppliers support more than 15 gigawatts of clean energy around the world today — enough to power over 5 million American homes. Across all product lines, more than 300 global suppliers — representing over 90 percent of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend — have now joined Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, committing to 100 percent renewable electricity for all Apple production by the end of this decade.
Electricity for manufacturing and charging devices represents the largest source of Apple’s emissions across all product lines. To address the latter, Apple has committed to invest in large-scale solar and wind projects around the world. For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, the company will match 100 percent of customers’ expected electricity use for charging.
Innovating in Low-Carbon Design
Apple has pioneered the use of many key recycled materials in its products through world-class product engineering, extensive design qualification, and supply chain expertise. The new products announced today build on these achievements.
To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple is ending the use of leather across all of its product lines, including iPhone accessories and Apple Watch bands. The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content. FineWoven offers a subtle luster and a soft, suedelike feel, and is available on iPhone MagSafe cases and wallets as well as the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle Apple Watch bands.
As recycled and renewable materials often have a lower carbon footprint than primary materials, Apple’s industry-leading progress in the use of recycled content also advances the company’s Apple 2030 goal. The new FineWoven material has significantly lower emissions compared to the more carbon-intensive leather, and both the new iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch lineups advance progress toward the company’s 2025 targets for the use of 100 percent recycled metals in key components. This includes 100 percent recycled rare earth magnets and the company’s first use of 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery of iPhone 15, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2.5Additionally, the popular Sport Loop has been redesigned with 82 percent recycled yarn, which includes material from discarded fishing nets. Customers looking to upgrade to the new carbon neutral Apple Watch models can take advantage of Apple Trade In, and Apple will refurbish the device for a new owner, or recycle it for free.
Apple is also accelerating progress toward plastic-free packaging by 2025. In addition to achieving the first 100 percent fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch and band lineup, the packaging for every iPhone 15 model is over 99 percent fiber-based.
Reducing Transportation Emissions
Transporting products around the world makes up about 9 percent of Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint. The company is shifting more product volume to shipping modes that are less carbon-intensive than air transport, such as ocean or rail. Apple’s carbon footprint methodology shows that shipping the same product by ocean emits 95 percent fewer emissions than by air.
For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, including watches and bands, the company will ship at least 50 percent of the combined weight using non-air modes, cutting total transportation emissions nearly in half. Additionally, the packaging of all Apple Watch Series 9 and SE models has been redesigned for compactness, with a new, smaller shape that allows for 25 percent more devices per shipment.
At the same time, Apple is committed to supporting broader efforts to decarbonize shipping industries, such as by being a member of the First Movers Coalition, and by supportinganalysisto identify pathways for developing sustainable aviation fuels. The company also seeks out technical innovations — including the use of alternative fuels and electric vehicles — and selects vendors that offer low-carbon options to help further drive decarbonization in the industry.
Investing in High-Quality Carbon Removal
After achieving steep reductions in product emissions, Apple plans to cover residual emissions with high-quality carbon credits primarily from nature-based projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere, like restoring grasslands, wetlands, and forests. Carbon removal is critical to addressing climate change and achieving global climate goals, as leading scientific bodies like the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have emphasized.
Apple defines high-quality credits as those from projects that are real, additional, measurable, and quantified, with systems in place to avoid double-counting, and that ensure permanence. Apple has helped advance natural carbon-removal solutions that meet this definition by creating the innovativeRestore Fund, which currently supports projects in Latin America. The company uses credits from projects that are certified to international standards such as Verra; the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards; and the Forest Stewardship Council.
For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, the high-quality carbon credits used to compensate for the remaining emissions will come from projects like the Restore Fund’s investments with Arbaro Advisors and BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, which are helping to restore and protect high-quality working forests and native ecosystems in Paraguay and Brazil.
Introducing Grid Forecast
As Apple decarbonizes its value chain, the company is also committed to engaging with customers and creating technology that helps them understand and address their environmental impact.
Grid Forecast is a new tool in the Home app on Apple devices that shows when a user’s electrical grid has relatively cleaner or less clean energy sources available. For example, there are times when wind and solar projects produce more energy than the grid can use, leading to some of it being wasted. There are also times when electricity is being generated with lower emissions. By using electricity during these cleaner times, customers may lower the climate impact of the electricity they use at home.
Apple uses data that combines grid, emissions, and weather information into one, easy-to-follow signal. This can help people make decisions about the best time to run large appliances and charge electric vehicles or devices throughout the day. In the contiguous United States, Grid Forecast is available in the Home app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, and can be added as an iOS widget or a watch face complication. As additional data becomes available through ongoing industry collaboration, Apple will continue refining Grid Forecast to maximize impact.
Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 percent reduction in emissions by 2050 — which requires advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple unveils Apple Watch Ultra 2
Apple’s most rugged and capable watch is now even better with performance updates, a new double tap gesture, and carbon neutral options
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducedApple Watch Ultra 2, bringing new features to Apple’s most capable and rugged smartwatch, and achieving a significant environmental milestone. Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers all of the features users love about Ultra, plus the powerful new S9 SiP, a magical new double tap gesture, Apple’s brightest display ever, expanded altitude range, on-device Siri, Precision Finding for iPhone, and advanced capabilities for water adventures. Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new cycling experiences, features to help explore the outdoors, and a new watch face — Modular Ultra. With all the new advancements, Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the same 36-hour battery life with regular use and up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode.
For the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple’s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030.
Apple Watch Ultra 2 can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22.
“This year we’ve made our most rugged and capable Apple Watch even better,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Ultra 2 is our most advanced Apple Watch, with great performance and feature updates. It’s perfect for anyone who wants our biggest, brightest display, longest battery life, and best GPS of any Apple Watch, all in a stunning design.”
Powerful New S9 SiP
Apple Watch Ultra 2 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Ultra 2 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast as the original Apple Watch Ultra.
Double Tap Gesture
Innovations such as the Digital Crown and Taptic Engine — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.
Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch, or even switch to the new Elevation view in the Compass app to see the relative elevation of saved waypoints.
The new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Ultra 2, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.
Brighter Display
A new advanced display architecture pushes the maximum brightness of Apple Watch Ultra 2 to 3000 nits — 50 percent brighter than the first generation of Apple Watch Ultra and the brightest display Apple has ever designed — for greater readability in harsh sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by. Flashlight also benefits from the new display architecture; rotating the Digital Crown temporarily doubles the brightness to better light the way.
Modular Ultra Watch Face
A new watch face designed for Apple Watch Ultra — Modular Ultra — takes advantage of the large display, using the outermost edge to present real-time data, including seconds, altitude, or depth. It offers the most complications of any Apple digital watch face to customize for sports, outdoor adventures, and ocean and water activities.
Tested for Extremes
Apple Watch Ultra 2 is designed for extremes and has been tested for use across the largest range of altitudes for any Apple product, from 500 meters below sea level to explore the lowest valleys, and up to 9,000 meters to ascend the world’s tallest peaks.
Recreational Scuba Diving and Freediving
Apple Watch Ultra is perfect for water sports, including extreme activities like kitesurfing and wakeboarding, along with recreational scuba diving to 40 meters — and now freediving — with the updated Oceanic+ app from Huish Outdoors.1
The built-in Depth app now saves a log of each session so users can review the most recent sessions on Apple Watch Ultra or view the complete history of all dives with a GPS entry point in the Fitness app on iPhone.
During a freedive with the Oceanic+ app, users will see critical data like depth and elapsed time, and receive target depth alerts, all in big, bold, glanceable text. Between dives, heart rate zones help users monitor and lower their heart rate, and preset alarms like surface time and elapsed session time guide users through each training session. The detailed logbook provides a full profile, including descent and ascent speeds.
On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data
For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, like starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate.
On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, to start an outdoor run or cycling workout, or make requests like setting a waypoint with just their voice, even with no connectivity. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Ultra 2 to log health data such as their weight, body temperature, period, or medications taken.2
Precision Finding
The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it’s in a different room or a user doesn’t remember where it’s been stowed after a dive, for example.
Featuring watchOS 10
Apple Watch Ultra 2 runswatchOS 10, a milestone update that includes:
Carbon Neutral Models
Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch SE, and the new Apple Watch Series 9 are Apple’s first-evercarbon neutral products. As part ofApple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch Ultra 2 paired with an Alpine Loop or Trail Loop features 95 percent recycled titanium, compared with no recycled titanium in the first Apple Watch Ultra.3A new logo on Apple Watch Ultra 2 packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral.

ProRes video can be recorded directly to external storage, enabling higher recording options up to 4K at 60 fps, and greater flexibility on set when using iPhone as the main camera. iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Color Encoding System, a global standard for color workflows.
Coming later this year, iPhone 15 Pro will add a new dimension to video capture with the ability to record spatial video for Apple Vision Pro. Users will be able to capture precious moments in three dimensions and relive those memories with incredible depth on Apple Vision Pro when it is available early next year in the U.S.
Next-Level Wireless Performance and Connectivity
The iPhone 15 Pro lineup offers convenient new ways to charge, find friends in busy places, and stay connected while traveling. Both models use the USB‑C connector, a universally accepted standard for charging and transferring data, allowing the same cable to charge iPhone, Mac, iPad, and the updated AirPods Pro (2nd generation). Users can also charge AirPods or Apple Watch directly from iPhone with the USB‑C connector. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support USB 3 for data transfer speeds up to 10 gigabits per second, up to 20x faster than before.
Both models feature the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, enabling two iPhone devices with this chip to connect at three times the range as before. This opens up a new way to use Precision Finding for Find My friends, so iPhone 15 users can share their location and find each other, even in crowds. Precision Finding is built with the same privacy protections that users have come to trust in Find My.5
iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now support Wi-Fi 6E for greater wireless performance, including up to 2x faster speeds, and introduce the first Thread-enabled smartphones, opening up future opportunities for Home app integrations.
iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come equipped with super-fast 5G,6and include:
Expanded Safety Capabilities for Peace of Mind
The iPhone 15 lineup offers critical safety capabilities to provide assistance when it matters most, including Crash Detection7and Emergency SOS via satellite.8Currently available in 14 countries and regions on three continents, Emergency SOS via satellite has made a significant impact in users’ lives. This groundbreaking service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month.
Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.9An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.10
Featuring iOS 17
iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature iOS 17,11making iPhone even more personal and intuitive with new features:
iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal,13a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, improvements to autocorrect and Dictation that make entering text faster and easier than ever before, password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain, and much more.
Better for the Environment
iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

2023-09-12,Decrease,Apple advances supplier clean energy commitments,"Text of this article
September 12, 2023
UPDATE
Apple advances supplier clean energy commitments
Apple today announced expanded progress to decarbonize its global supply chain, with more than 300 manufacturers now committed to using 100 percent clean energy for their Apple production by 2030. New commitments from more than 50 suppliers in the U.S., Europe, and Asia have driven recent growth in Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, which now represents over 90 percent of the company’s direct manufacturing spend. The milestone brings Apple closer to its ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across every product by 2030.
“As we experience record temperatures and devastating storms, we all have an urgent responsibility to reduce emissions and protect against the worst impacts of climate change,” said Sarah Chandler, Apple’s vice president of Environment and Supply Chain Innovation. “At Apple, we’re proud that so many of our suppliers are taking action as we drive progress toward a carbon neutral future.”
Already carbon neutral for its global corporate operations since 2020, Apple’s 2030 strategy is centered on the science-based target of reducing emissions by 75 percent by the end of the decade. Since 2015, Apple has worked in close partnership with its global suppliers to address the electricity used to manufacture Apple products. Manufacturing is the single largest source of emissions in the company’s carbon footprint, and powering it with 100 percent clean energy is a key driver in making all Apple products carbon neutral — like those in the new Apple Watch lineup.
Suppliers operating in 28 countries have committed to bringing over 20 gigawatts of renewable energy online through Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program. Newly committed partners in advanced manufacturing technologies include Skyworks Solutions, Analog Devices, Cirrus Logic, and more in the U.S., and Renesas Electronics in Japan. The number of participating Korean suppliers has grown nearly 30 percent this year, to 23. In China, 14 more companies have pledged to use clean energy since April 2023, including Jingmen GEM, a supplier of key recycled material used in Apple products. Across Europe, companies including Sappi Limited, LeMur, and Schoeller Textil AG have recently joined, bringing the total to 34 suppliers.
Apple has been tracking yearly progress on suppliers reducing their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and in the fall of 2022, the company called on suppliers to decarbonize their Apple production by 2030. In 2022, the 13.7 gigawatts of renewable electricity online in Apple’s supply chain avoided 17.4 million metric tons of carbon emissions — the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. With support from Apple to identify sources of high-quality renewable energy, many suppliers have also chosen to decarbonize beyond their Apple production.
As a result of Apple’s environmental efforts, the company has cut its overall emissions by over 45 percent since 2015, even as its business has grown. Apple continues to invest in innovative environmental approaches — including low-carbon product design, new recycling technologies, its Restore Fund, and $4.7 billion in Green Bonds. Additional information on Apple’s environmental progress is available atapple.com/2030.

2023-09-12,Decrease,Apple introduces the advanced new Apple Watch Series 9,"Text of this article
September 12, 2023
PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces the advanced new Apple Watch Series 9
Featuring breakthrough capabilities for the world’s most popular watch and Apple’s first carbon neutral products
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducedApple Watch Series 9, bringing new features to the world’s best-selling watch and achieving a significant environmental milestone. Apple Watch Series 9 is more powerful than ever with the new S9 SiP, which increases performance and capabilities; a magical new double tap gesture; a brighter display; faster on-device Siri, now with the ability to access and log health data; Precision Finding for iPhone; and more. Apple Watch Series 9 runs watchOS 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new watch faces, new cycling and hiking features, and tools to support mental health.
For the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple’s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030.
The new Apple Watch lineup can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22.
“Apple Watch is an indispensable companion that helps millions of people with their health, fitness, communications, and safety,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “We’re introducing our best Apple Watch lineup, with incredible new capabilities and technological advancements, including a new double tap gesture, brighter display, on-device Siri, as well as our first-ever carbon neutral products. Whether users are upgrading from earlier models or buying their first, there’s never been a more compelling time to experience Apple Watch.”
“At Apple, we are committed to making products customers love and protecting the planet at the same time, and this year, we hit a key milestone toward our Apple 2030 goal,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “Our first carbon neutral products were made in a uniquely Apple way, steeply reducing carbon emissions from materials, electricity, and transportation through innovation and design.”
Powerful New S9 SiP
Apple Watch Series 9 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Series 9 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, when compared with Apple Watch Series 8. The power efficiency of the S9 SiP allows Apple Watch Series 9 to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life.1
Double Tap Gesture
Innovations such as the Digital Crown and Taptic Engine — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9.
Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, and even to take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.
This new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Series 9, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.
Brighter Display
The power-efficient S9 SiP and advanced display architecture increase the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display up to 2000 nits — double that of Series 8 — making it even easier to read text in bright sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by.
On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data
For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate than Apple Watch Series 8.
On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, or about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as their weight, period, or medications taken.2
Precision Finding and HomePod Integration
The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room.
UWB also brings deeper integration between Apple Watch and HomePod. When an Apple Watch user gets within 4 meters of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media. Or if nothing is playing on HomePod, media suggestions will appear at the top of the Smart Stack.
Featuring watchOS 10
Apple Watch Series 9 runswatchOS 10, a milestone update that includes:
Carbon Neutral Models
Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Apple Watch SE are Apple’s first-evercarbon neutral products. As part ofApple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch packaging has been redesigned to be 100 percent fiber-based, and a new logo on the packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral.
Apple Watch SE
Apple Watch SEcontinues to deliver the core Apple Watch experience at a more affordable price point, and is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, use with Family Setup, or gift to their loved ones. Additionally, Apple Watch SE offers Activity tracking, high and low heart rate notifications, Fall Detection, Emergency SOS, Crash Detection, and watchOS 10.
Lineup
Bands
Apple is introducing FineWoven, a luxurious and durable microtwill made of 68 percent post-consumer recycled content that has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather. FineWoven has a suedelike feel, and is available with the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle bands. Starting today, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple product, including watch bands.
The popular Sport Loop band has been redesigned to include 82 percent recycled yarn. All new Apple Watch Sport Loops are carbon neutral.
Apple worked with Nike and Hermès on more environmentally friendly band collections. The Nike Sport Band now contains 32 percent or more recycled fluoroelastomer, including colorful flakes made from excess bands that create a randomized pattern, making each band unique, while the Nike Sport Loop with a space-dye pattern repurposes yarn from previous seasons.
A new collection of Hermès bands draws on the house’s rich history in textiles and craftsmanship. Two new woven bands are introduced: Toile H is an interpretation of the brand’s signature checked canvas, and Twill Jump is a rich solid color with contrasting details. The first-ever knitted band for Apple Watch, Bridon, is hand-braided with a bold chevron pattern, while Kilim is made of sporty, waterproof molded rubber and has a deployment buckle. A classic new watch face, Hermès Radial, complements these four new band styles.3

2023-09-18,Increase,watchOS 10 is available today,"Text of this article
September 18, 2023
UPDATE
watchOS 10 is available today
Apple today releasedwatchOS 10, a milestone update bringing a new visual language to apps to see more information at a glance, a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed, and delightful new watch faces. Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrive for cyclists, unlocking new metrics and Workout Views, and cycling workouts will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and utilize the full screen. Additionally, new Compass Waypoints and Maps capabilities can further help during outdoor adventures. The Mindfulness app offers new tools to support mental health with state of mind logging, and Apple Watch also introduces the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor.
New Design Language and Navigation
Apple Watch apps, including Weather, Stocks, Home, Maps, Messages, World Clock, and others, now utilize more of the Apple Watch display for more glanceable information. The Activity app on Apple Watch and the Fitness app on iPhone make tracking daily movement even easier with more details, improvements to sharing, a redesigned trophy case, and Apple Fitness+ trainer tips.
A new Smart Stack contains widgets that display timely information that adapts to the user’s context and can be revealed with a simple turn of the Digital Crown from any watch face. For example, at the beginning of the day, Weather will show the forecast, or, when traveling, the Smart Stack will show boarding passes from Wallet. Calendar and Reminders will reshuffle to the top to display upcoming meetings or tasks, and apps that are running, such as Podcasts, will also move up so they are readily available. Smart Stack also enables users to enjoy a beautiful watch face, like Portraits, while still offering a way to quickly access information they care about.
Control Center is now accessible using the side button, making it easy to quickly open it at any time, over any app. A double-click of the Digital Crown reverts back to any apps used recently.
New Watch Faces
watchOS 10 introduces five new watch faces: Snoopy, Palette, Solar Analog, Nike Globe, and Modular Ultra for Apple Watch Ultra.
Cycling
Apple Watch is a great device for cyclists, with features including automatic Workout reminders, calorimetry for e-biking, and Fall Detection. watchOS 10 takes this popular activity even further with advanced new metrics, views, and experiences.
When a cycling workout is started from Apple Watch in watchOS 10, it will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and, when tapped, will utilize the full screen. Workout Views, such as Heart Rate Zones, Elevation, Race Route, Custom Workouts, and a new Cycling Speed view, have been optimized for the display size of iPhone, which can be mounted to a bike’s handlebars for convenient, easy viewing during a ride.
Apple Watch can now automatically connect to Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories, such as power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors. This enables brand-new metrics, including cycling power (watts) and cadence (RPM), and additional Workout Views, including Power Zones. Bluetooth connection is supported for Indoor and Outdoor cycling workouts, as well as GymKit.
New algorithms combining sensor data from Apple Watch and connected power meters can estimate Functional Threshold Power (FTP), the highest level of cycling intensity that a rider could theoretically maintain for an hour. Using FTP, Apple Watch calculates personalized Power Zones, used to easily see the current zone and track how long is spent in each, which is an effective and popular way of improving performance.
Compass and Maps
The Compass app on Apple Watch is a helpful tool for exploring the great outdoors. With watchOS 10, Compass automatically generates two new waypoints when available: A Last Cellular Connection Waypoint will estimate the last place with cellular reception, which may be useful for checking messages or making a call. In case of emergencies, a Last Emergency Call Waypoint will estimate where on the route their device had the last connection to any available carrier’s network so that an emergency call may be made.
When preparing routes, a new Elevation view uses altimeter data, offering a three-dimensional view of saved waypoints. And starting in the U.S., Apple Maps displays a new topographic map featuring contour lines, hill shading, elevation details, and points of interest. Users can also search for nearby trails and trailheads, with place cards that include detailed information, like trail length, type, and difficulty.
Mental Health
With the Mindfulness app in watchOS 10, users can discreetly and conveniently log their momentary emotions and daily moods. Users can turn the Digital Crown to scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes to choose how they are feeling, select what is having the biggest impact on them, and further describe their feelings.
In the Health app in iOS 17 and iPadOS 17, users can see valuable insights to identify what might be contributing to their state of mind — whether it’s associations or lifestyle factors, like sleep or exercise.
Vision Health
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the leading cause of vision impairment globally. To reduce the risk of myopia, the International Myopia Institute recommends children spend at least 80-120 minutes a day outdoors. With watchOS 10, Apple Watch introduces the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor. Users can view this information in the Health app on iPhone or iPad.
Time spent in daylight can provide additional benefits to physical and mental health for all ages.

2023-09-18,Increase,iOS 17 is available today,"Text of this article
September 18, 2023
UPDATE
iOS 17 is available today
iOS 17 makes iPhone even more personal and intuitive with major updates to communication apps; StandBy, a new way to experience iPhone when it is charging; easier sharing with AirDrop; and more intelligent input that improves the speed and accuracy of typing.iOS 17is available today as a free software update.
Incoming Calls Get a Major Upgrade
The Phone app is essential to the iPhone experience, and it receives a big update that makes the calls that matter stand out even more. Personalized Contact Posters provide a new way for users to express themselves by customizing how they appear when they call known contacts, including in third-party calling apps. Contact Posters can be personalized with beautiful treatments for photos, Memoji, and eye-catching typography and font colors.
Live Voicemail provides a real-time transcription as someone leaves a voicemail, and gives users the opportunity to pick up while the caller is leaving their message. With the power of the Neural Engine, Live Voicemail transcription is handled on-device and remains private. With Silence Unknown Callers enabled, unknown numbers are transferred directly to Live Voicemail, and calls identified as spam by carriers are instantly declined.
New Ways to Enjoy FaceTime
Users are now able to leave a video or audio message on FaceTime to capture exactly what they want to say when someone they call is not available. FaceTime calls get more expressive with Reactions such as hearts, balloons, fireworks, and laser beams that can be activated by simple gestures, and are also available with supported third-party video conferencing apps, such as Zoom and Webex by Cisco.
FaceTime now features an incredible connected experience with Apple TV 4K. To see friends and family on the big screen, users can use Continuity Camera to start a FaceTime call on iPhone and hand it off to Apple TV, or initiate the FaceTime call directly from their Apple TV. With Center Stage, users stay perfectly framed even as they move around the room.
More Ways to Stay Connected with Messages
Messages adds new features that make it easier to use and even more fun when connecting with the people who matter the most.
Search gets more powerful and precise with search filters; audio messages get automatically transcribed so users can read them in the moment or listen later; replying inline becomes as simple as swiping on a text bubble; and the new expandable menu provides easy access to all iMessage apps, giving Messages a sleeker look.
Users now have another way to customize their messages with an all-new stickers experience that adds the ability to create Live Stickers by lifting subjects from photos. Fun effects can be added to stickers, bringing them to life and giving users a way to be creative.
Check In, an important feature built into Messages, lets users notify a family member or friend when they have made it to their destination safely. After a user starts a Check In, their contact will automatically be notified as soon as they arrive. If they are not making progress toward their destination, useful information, such as the device’s location, battery level, and cell service status, is temporarily shared with the selected contact in a secure and private way.
StandBy Makes iPhone Even More Useful While It’s Charging
StandBy is a new full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance while iPhone is on its side and charging. StandBy is perfect on a desk, nightstand, or kitchen counter, and can be personalized to display a range of clock styles, favorite photos, or widgets, including Smart Stacks, which surface the right widgets at the right time. StandBy also displays full-screen Live Activities, Siri results, incoming calls, and larger notifications. With the Always-On display, StandBy stays on to show useful information, and with Night Mode, StandBy adapts to low light, so clocks, photos, and widgets take on a beautiful red tone. When using a MagSafe charger, StandBy will remember a user’s preferred view for that MagSafe charging dock.
Easier Sharing with AirDrop and NameDrop
AirDrop makes it easier than ever to share with friends, family, and colleagues. NameDrop, a new AirDrop feature, lets users exchange contact information, including their Contact Poster, simply by bringing their iPhone devices together. With the same gesture, users can also share content or start SharePlay to listen to music, watch a movie, or play a game while in close proximity. And later this year, AirDrop will add the ability to continue transfers over the internet when a user steps out of AirDrop range.
Comprehensive Updates to Autocorrect and Dictation
Autocorrect receives a comprehensive update with a new transformer language model, a state-of-the-art on-device machine learning language model for word prediction — improving the experience and accuracy for users every time they type. Sentence-level autocorrections can fix more types of grammatical mistakes, and the refreshed design better supports typing by temporarily underlining corrected words and allowing users to revert back with just a tap. Inline predictive text helps quickly finish sentences, while Dictation’s new speech recognition model brings improved accuracy.
Reflecting on Life’s Moments with Journal
Journal is a new iPhone app that helps users reflect on everyday moments and special events in their lives. To help inspire a user’s journal entry, personalized suggestions can be intelligently curated from a user’s recent activity, such as photos, people, places, workouts, and more, and scheduled notifications can help build a journaling habit. With the ability to lock the app, the use of on-device processing, and end-to-end encryption, Journal is built to protect a user’s privacy and ensure no one — including Apple — can access a user’s entries. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, developers will be able to add journaling suggestions to their apps. The Journal app and Journaling Suggestions API will be available in a software update later this year.
Additional Features in iOS 17
Availability
iOS 17 is a free software update that is available starting today for iPhone Xs and later. For more information, visitapple.com/ios/ios-17.

2023-09-26,Decrease,macOS Sonoma is available today,"Text of this article
September 26, 2023
UPDATE
macOS Sonoma is available today
macOS Sonomais now available as a free software update, bringing a rich set of new features to the Mac that make work and play even more powerful. With macOS Sonoma, desktop widgets unlock a new way to personalize the Mac and get more done, while stunning new screen savers, big updates to video conferencing and Safari, along with optimized gaming make the Mac experience better than ever.
Widgets and Stunning Screen Savers
With macOS Sonoma, widgets can be placed right on the desktop and blend seamlessly with the wallpaper while other windows are open. Widgets also become interactive so users can complete a reminder, play or pause media, access home controls, and perform various tasks directly from the widget on their desktop. And through the magic of Continuity, users can further customize their Mac with widgets from their iPhone.
A new selection of screen savers in macOS Sonoma features slow-motion videos of beautiful locations around the world, such as the sweeping skyline of Hong Kong, the sandstone buttes of Monument Valley in Arizona, and the rolling hills of Sonoma in Northern California. And after login, the screen savers seamlessly transition to become the desktop wallpaper.
Powerful Productivity for Video Conferencing
macOS Sonoma brings enhanced video conferencing features that enable users to present and share their work more effectively within any video conferencing app. Presenter Overlay displays users in front of the content they are sharing, and Reactions allow users to share how they feel with simple hand gestures that trigger fun, frame-filling 3D effects like balloons, confetti, hearts, and more.
Enhanced Browsing with Safari
In Safari, profiles keep browsing separate between topics like work, school, and more so users can quickly switch between them. Private Browsing gets even better with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track users — Private Browsing windows become locked when not in use and known trackers are blocked from loading. Safari users can also now add any website to the Dock as they would with an app, complete with a simplified toolbar and notifications for an app-like experience.
An Immersive Gaming Experience
With the power of Apple silicon, tens of millions of Macs can run demanding games with great performance, long battery life, and breathtaking visuals. macOS Sonoma improves the gaming experience even further with Game Mode, providing more consistent frame rates and dramatically reducing input and audio latency with wireless game controllers and AirPods.Game Mode works with any game, including recent and upcoming Mac games like DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR’S CUT, Stray, Layers of Fear, and SnowRunner.
Additional macOS Sonoma Updates
Availability
macOS Sonoma is a free software update that is available starting today. Some features may not be available in all regions, languages, or on all devices. For more information and a full list of features, visitapple.com/macos/sonoma.

2023-10-04,Increase,Apple resources are helping Houston educators nurture the next generation of Hispanic leaders and innovators,"I believe that all students can do anything, you just need the right tools, the right coach, and the right connection.
Juan Marquez, educator, TechConnect leader
Text of this article
October 4, 2023
UPDATE
Apple resources are helping Houston educators nurture the next generation of Hispanic leaders and innovators
Through its Community Education Initiative, Apple partners with over 150 organizations to bring advanced technology skills to students of all ages
The kids are excited — you can hear them before you see them. Groups of giddy 6-year-olds, boisterous preteens, and every age in between flood into the gym. They’re each handed an iPad for the day, and directed to one of TechConnect’s five program activity stations.
Noe Moreno and Giovanni Victorio, both 18, are ready for them. The TechConnect interns have spent the morning creating a racetrack for programmable Sphero robots that help teach the basics of coding, and now they’re going to show the kids how to control them using iPad. It’s the last TechConnect event of the summer, and the two young men are independently running their station for the day. Their trainer and mentor, Juan Marquez, stands back, watching proudly.
TechConnect was created in 2016 by Houston City Council Member Karla Cisneros to introduce advanced technology skills like coding to kids that wouldn’t otherwise have the opportunity. In 2022, it became one of the hundreds of programs supported by Apple’s Community Education Initiative (CEI), which was designed to bring coding, creativity, and career opportunities to learners of all ages, and to communities that are traditionally underrepresented in technology.
Since its inception in 2019, CEI has reached tens of thousands of students in 99 countries and regions, and in all 50 United States, through its collaboration with more than 150 educational partners. Apple provides hardware, financial support, scholarships, educator resources, and access to Apple experts who work side by side with organizations to enhance learning experiences through technology.
Juan Marquez has been involved with TechConnect for the past year — and has been part of Apple’s CEI programming in Houston from its inception, mentoring thousands of students and interns with Apple educational resources like Everyone Can Create and Everyone Can Code. He also teaches high school computer science, and has used Apple technology to enhance subjects as varied as reading, social studies, and science since he moved from his native Mexico to teach in the U.S. in 2015.
“If you follow Apple’s learning materials, they are very user-friendly for teaching young people critical learning skills that can help in every area,” says Marquez. “There are always examples of things you can try that, right away, you see results. And I think that’s important because once students hit a roadblock — and this is especially important in programming or coding — they can get frustrated. And with the iPad, you don’t have that.”
One of the resources Marquez has used is Apple’sChallenge for Change Learning Series, which encourages students to solve real challenges in their communities using technology as a tool. Today, Apple released a new installment in which Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai encourages learners to use storytelling to create positive change. Marquez is excited to introduce this new material to learners in Mexico and in his community in Texas.
The father of two has seen the positive impact of TechConnect from day one, especially on students from Houston’s Hispanic and Latinx communities. It’s what spurred him to bring the program across the border and introduce it to students in Puebla, Mexico.
“This program is mind-blowing,” says Marquez. “Especially coming from Mexico where it’s difficult to find resources, it became so important for me to bring this level of opportunity and learning to kids who have almost no access to technology. I believe that all students can do anything, you just need the right tools, the right coach, and the right connection.”
Back in the gym, youthful chaos has been replaced by intense concentration. At the Sphero station, a new group of mostly 12-year-old boys has joined. Moreno notices that one of them has finished the first task — using his iPad to send the Sphero to the end of the course — before any of the others. Now his focus is shifting.
Moreno immediately leans in and asks if the student can take his Sphero through the middle of the course while avoiding all of the foam barriers. “I want to challenge your thinking,” he yells. “Use that big brain!”
Minutes later, task completed, the student lets out a whoop and raises his fist in triumph.
Moreno and Victorio have been TechConnect paid summer interns for the last two years and have been rehired to run TechConnect fairs this fall. They see the program not just as an opportunity to share their knowledge of technology, but also a way to give back to their community.
“I really do see it as an important obligation,” says Victorio, who is currently in his freshman year studying mechanical engineering at the University of Houston. “I feel like there’s a sort of moral compass inside that steers you to redirect what you’ve been given and help guide others. And having a positive impact, especially on kids who were basically me a few years ago, is really amazing.”
TechConnect is just one of the programs supported through CEI in the Houston area that is helping young people harness the power of technology. At Houston Community College (HCC), faculty members run an annual information technology summer camp that has introduced more than 2,500 middle and high school students to a variety of subjects that incorporate coding using Apple technology.
The camp is the brainchild of Dr. Madeline Burillo-Hopkins, president of Houston Community College’s Southwest College, who has made it her mission to bring cutting-edge technology and advanced career opportunities to her student body. HCC was one of the first community colleges in the country to offer Apple’s App Development with Swift program in 2017.
“When I started at HCC, I looked at the data and saw that the numbers of women in our technology programs were low, and I knew I had to work to change that,” says Dr. Burillo-Hopkins, who grew up in Puerto Rico and was the first in her family to go to college. “This camp is helping young women get into that pipeline early, and we know that’s a critical step. Apple’s support is a huge part of that, and shows young Hispanic girls and young Black girls what’s possible in terms of being the next creators, developers, and innovators.”
Sisters Soleil and Lluvia San Miguel, 10 and 11, respectively, attended the camp for the first time this summer. When they get older, Lluvia wants to be an astronaut, and Soleil wants to be a teacher and use coding in her classroom. Their mother, Blanca San Miguel, credits experiences like the HCC camp with nurturing their interest in science and technology.
“I wanted to expose them to more opportunities than what I had when I was young,” says San Miguel. “For Hispanic girls especially, it’s important for them to know that STEM is going to show you endless possibilities for the future — and it’s definitely not just for boys!”
To celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, HCC is hosting dozens of events throughout its campuses. The college is a recognized Hispanic-Serving Institution, meaning that at least 25 percent of its student body is Hispanic.
“Educating and integrating technology and digital skills among the next generation of Hispanic learners is critically important,” says Dr. Burillo-Hopkins. “Especially as the demographics of this country change, and Hispanic and Latino communities grow and become a larger percentage of the workforce, education is integral to a healthy U.S. economy.”
The day is coming to an end at TechConnect, and the last group of students is quietly and intensely directing their Sphero robots through the course. Moments later time is up, the devices are handed back, and the gym is again filled with noisy pandemonium as the students file out.
The interns start to pack up their station and Marquez comes by for a final goodbye, exchanging contact information so they can stay in touch. The gesture means a lot to both young men.
“Juan is such an awesome teacher,” says Moreno, who is planning on studying psychology at the University of Houston next year. “I’ve had long conversations with him about the work he’s doing here and in Mexico and you can see how much he loves it and what it means to him. It’s a powerful journey that he’s on and he’s really helping a lot of people.”
For Marquez, there is nothing more important than seeing students he’s mentored like Moreno and Victorio thriving.
“I believe that in order for learning to happen, there has to be a connection between the learner and the teacher,” says Marquez. “Apple tools are a big part of that — they make learning fun and engaging while helping students find their own way. And being able to see how somebody I helped is succeeding without my help — that’s really a big reward for me. It makes me feel proud. I feel like my job is done.”

2023-10-18,Increase,New Apple research highlights the health benefits of pickleball,"Text of this article
October 18, 2023
UPDATE
New Apple research highlights the health benefits of pickleball
The Apple Heart and Movement Study reveals tennis and pickleball are a win for overall health, as pickleball’s popularity continues to rise
Researchers from the Apple Heart and Movement Study share new insights into one of the fastest-growing sports around the world: pickleball. To see how this emerging sport compared against the long-standing game of tennis, and how it impacts overall health, researchers turned to the data.
In one of the largest observational datasets of pickleball activity collected using Apple Watch, researchers found trends in both pickleball and tennis workout data that highlight the potential health benefits of both activities.
Participants often played pickleball and tennis for long periods of time, averaging a peak heart rate within 70 percent of their estimated max heart rate during recorded workouts. Pickleball workouts lasted for slightly longer than tennis workouts, while tennis workouts averaged more time spent in higher-intensity heart rate zones and had a higher average peak heart rate.
Researchers also saw a steady increase in the popularity of pickleball workouts, with pickleball workouts surpassing tennis workouts for the first time. Utah took the top spot as the state with the most recorded pickleball workouts per capita in the study. The research found that both pickleball and tennis workouts were popular across all adult ages, and both were more popular with men than women.
Observing participant behavior, coupled with activity and sensor data from Apple Watch, helps advance researchers’ understanding of factors affecting heart health and mobility over time.
“The Apple Heart and Movement Study offers us remarkable opportunities to follow participants’ behavior changes and the consequences of these changes on health,” said Calum MacRae, M.D., Ph.D., a cardiologist, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and principal investigator of the Apple Heart and Movement Study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Following the growth of pickleball using Apple Watch data allows us to explore emerging trends and the effects of activity on multiple metrics of health and wellness that were not accessible before.”
The Apple Heart and Movement Study is one of three public research studies Apple introduced in the Research app, in collaboration with leading institutions. The Research app gives researchers the ability to broaden the scale and scope of their studies, helping uncover new scientific findings, and furthers Apple’s ability to create new features grounded in science in the process.
Paddles and Rackets: Both Offer a Healthy Activity for All
After analyzing more than 250,000 pickleball and tennis workouts recorded on Apple Watch by study participants, researchers found pickleball workouts were slightly longer than tennis workouts on average — 90 minutes versus 81 minutes, respectively — and saw greater variability in time played.
To assess the intensity of each workout type, researchers analyzed heart rate data. The average peak heart rate was nine beats per minute faster during tennis workouts, which averaged 152 beats per minute, compared to 143 beats per minute in pickleball.
Heart rate zones are another way to assess exercise effort. While both sports had similar trends in time spent within each heart rate zone, on average, tennis workouts had nine percentage points more time in higher-intensity heart rate zones compared to pickleball workouts.
Both pickleball and tennis workouts were often played for long periods of time, with participants averaging a peak heart rate within 70 percent of their estimated max heart rate during recorded workouts. Regular physical activity is associated with improved quality of life and healthy aging.
A Match with Mindfulness
The potential impact of exercise on mental health was important for researchers to consider. The study offers participants an optional mental health survey that includes a depression screening tool called the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2).
Across the study, results consistent with a depressed mood were rare, but the distribution of PHQ-2 scores was lower among frequent pickleball and tennis players. The odds of the PHQ-2 results suggestive of depressed mood were 60.1 percent lower among frequent pickleball players and 51.3 percent lower among tennis players than the general participant pool, reinforcing the potential benefits of physical activity on mental wellbeing.
“Research is a vital component to our work in health at Apple, and it’s important to see the science behind the mental and physical benefits of activities like pickleball and tennis on Apple Watch users,” said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health. “Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a number of other chronic conditions. Finding an activity that someone enjoys partaking in can help build a routine, whether that means picking up a paddle or a racket.”
According to the study, in July 2023, the number of participants playing pickleball in a single month surpassed the number of participants playing tennis for the first time. Tennis workout trends saw seasonal variation, while pickleball workouts saw relatively steady growth.
“We are pleased to see pickleball-related findings included in the Apple Heart and Movement Study, in collaboration with Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the American Heart Association. There are numerous benefits for individuals of all ages and backgrounds on the pickleball courts as part of a healthy, social, and active lifestyle,” said Mike Nealy, USA Pickleball’s chief executive officer. “As the sport’s national governing body in the United States, it’s increasingly meaningful to see science behind pickleball using real-world data from Apple Watch. The relatively low-impact, informal, and social nature of pickleball can offer a useful and enjoyable outlet for those looking to increase movement and add to their workouts.”
The research found that both sports were popular across ages and more popular for men than women. On average, players who logged at least 10 pickleball workouts were older than their counterparts in tennis — 51 versus 45, respectively — and had higher female participation rates.
Utah Picklers Earn Top Spot
A hub for the sport, Utah stood out in the research as the most popular state per capita for pickleball, with just over one in every 16 study participants giving the sport a try at least once.
“We’re excited to see that in the latest research study update from the Apple Heart and Movement Study, Utah stood out as the most popular state per capita for pickleball. It’s awesome that so many Utahns are grabbing the opportunity pickleball offers to incorporate activity into their days, and this research is a great reminder that exercise of any kind is a powerful way to improve our health over the long term,” said Spencer J. Cox, Utah’s governor.
About the Apple Heart and Movement Study
The Apple Heart and Movement Study, a collaboration with Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the American Heart Association, and Apple, explores the links between physical activity and heart health, and has more than 200,000 participants across the United States who have given their consent to share data.

October 25, 2023
UPDATE
Apple Watch double tap gesture now available with watchOS 10.1
The new double tap gesture for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available today with watchOS 10.1, bringing a fast and convenient new way to interact with Apple Watch.
With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly perform many of the most common actions. This new feature complements existing gestures like tap, swipe, raise to wake, and cover to mute that make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use.
A Convenient, Delightful Experience
The double tap gesture is helpful in common situations when the user’s other hand is occupied, such as when walking the dog, cooking, or holding a cup of coffee.
Double tap allows users to select the primary action in a wide variety of watchOS apps and notifications, including:
Powered by S9 SiP
The double tap gesture available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 is powered by the S9 SiP, which is 25 percent more power efficient than the previous generation, and the new 4-core Neural Engine, which can perform machine learning tasks twice as fast.
The Neural Engine processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap.
The double tap gesture works anytime the display is awake, and the feature is available all day long with minimal impact to the 18-hour battery life on Apple Watch Series 9 or the 36-hour battery life on Apple Watch Ultra 2.
Double Tap Gesture Customizations
Double tap has been designed to automatically select the primary action for most apps and notifications. In two instances, the user can elect a different function: advancing through widgets in the Smart Stack or selecting the first available widget; and playing or pausing media during an active session, or skipping to the next track instead.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple unveils M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max, the most advanced chips for a personal computer
The industry’s first 3-nanometer chips for a personal computer debut a next-generation GPU architecture and deliver dramatic performance improvements, a faster CPU and Neural Engine, and support for more unified memory
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max, three chips featuring groundbreaking technologies that deliver dramatically increased performance and unleash new capabilities for Mac. These are the first personal computer chips built using the industry-leading 3-nanometer process technology, allowing more transistors to be packed into a smaller space and improving speed and efficiency. Together, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max show how far Apple silicon for the Mac has come since the debut of the M1 family of chips.
The M3 family of chips features a next-generation GPU that represents the biggest leap forward in graphics architecture ever for Apple silicon. The GPU is faster and more efficient, and introduces a new technology called Dynamic Caching, while bringing new rendering features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading to Mac for the first time. Rendering speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips.1The CPU performance cores and efficiency cores are 30 percent and 50 percent faster than those in M1, respectively, and the Neural Engine is 60 percent faster than the Neural Engine in the M1 family of chips. And, a new media engine now includes support for AV1 decode, providing more efficient and high-quality video experiences from streaming services. The M3 family of chips continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon, and brings massive enhancements and new features to the newMacBook ProandiMac.
“Apple silicon has completely redefined the Mac experience. Every aspect of its architecture is designed for performance and power efficiency,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With 3-nanometer technology, a next-generation GPU architecture, a higher-performance CPU, faster Neural Engine, and support for even more unified memory, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max are the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer.”
All-New GPU Features Dynamic Caching, Mesh Shading, and Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing
The next-generation GPU inside the M3 family of chips represents the largest leap forward in graphics architecture for Apple silicon. It features Dynamic Caching that, unlike traditional GPUs, allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time. With Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.
With the M3 family of chips, hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to the Mac for the first time. Ray tracing models the properties of light as it interacts with a scene, allowing apps to create extremely realistic and physically accurate images. This, along with the new graphics architecture, allows pro apps to deliver up to 2.5x the speed of the M1 family of chips. Game developers can use ray tracing for more accurate shadows and reflections, creating deeply immersive environments. Additionally, the new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading to the Mac, delivering greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, and enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. This breakthrough GPU architecture enables all of these enhancements and features while maintaining Apple silicon’s legendary power efficiency. In fact, the M3 GPU is able to deliver the same performance as M1 using nearly half the power, and up to 65 percent more performance at its peak.
A Faster and More Efficient CPU
The next-generation CPU in M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max features architectural improvements to the performance and efficiency cores. The performance cores are up to 30 percent faster than those in the M1 family, so tasks like compiling and testing millions of lines of code in Xcode are even faster, and musicians can use hundreds of audio tracks, plug-ins, and virtual instruments in Logic Pro. The efficiency cores are up to 50 percent faster than the efficiency cores in M1, so everyday tasks are faster than ever, while allowing the system to maximize battery life. Together, these cores create a CPU that delivers the same multithreaded performance as M1 using as little as half the power, and up to 35 percent more performance at peak power.
Unrivaled Unified Memory Architecture, up to 128GB
Each chip in the M3 family features a unified memory architecture, a hallmark of Apple silicon. This delivers high bandwidth, low latency, and unmatched power efficiency. Having a single pool of memory within a custom package means all of the technologies in the chip can access the same data without copying it between multiple pools of memory, further improving performance and efficiency, and reducing the amount of memory a system requires for the majority of tasks. Additionally, support for up to 128GB of memory unlocks workflows previously not possible on a laptop, such as AI developers working with even larger transformer models with billions of parameters.
Custom Engines for AI and Video
M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max also have an enhanced Neural Engine to accelerate powerful machine learning (ML) models. The Neural Engine is up to 60 percent faster than in the M1 family of chips, making AI/ML workflows even faster while keeping data on device to preserve privacy. Powerful AI image processing tools, like noise reduction and super resolution in Topaz, get even faster. Scene edit detection in Adobe Premiere and Smart Conform in Final Cut Pro also see a boost in performance.
All three chips in the M3 family also have an advanced media engine, providing hardware acceleration to the most popular video codecs, including H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW. And for the first time, the media engine supports AV1 decoding, enabling power-efficient playback of streaming services to further extend battery life.
M3: Phenomenal Performance for the Most Popular Systems
M3 features 25 billion transistors — 5 billion more than M2. It has a 10-core GPU featuring the next-generation architecture that is 65 percent faster than M1 for graphics performance. Games like Myst have incredibly realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections. M3 has an 8-core CPU, with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, that is up to 35 percent faster than M1 for CPU performance. And it supports up to 24GB of unified memory.
M3 Pro: For Users Who Need Even More Performance
M3 Pro consists of 37 billion transistors and an 18-core GPU, delivering extremely fast performance when working on more graphics-intensive tasks. The GPU is up to 40 percent faster than M1 Pro. Support for unified memory goes up to 36GB, enabling larger projects to be tackled on MacBook Pro when users are on the go. The 12-core CPU design has six performance cores and six efficiency cores, offering single-threaded performance that is up to 30 percent faster than M1 Pro. Actions like stitching together and manipulating enormous panoramic photos in Adobe Photoshop are faster than ever with M3 Pro on the new MacBook Pro.
M3 Max: A Tremendous Leap in Performance for the Most Demanding Pro Workloads
M3 Max pushes the transistor count up to 92 billion and takes pro performance to the next level. The 40-core GPU is up to 50 percent faster than M1 Max, and support for up to 128GB of unified memory allows AI developers to work with even larger transformer models with billions of parameters. The 16-core CPU features 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores, achieving astonishing performance that’s up to 80 percent faster than M1 Max. And with two ProRes engines, M3 Max makes video post-production work on even the highest-resolution content fast and fluid, whether using DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro. M3 Max is designed for pros needing the highest performance available in a MacBook Pro with industry-leading battery life in a pro laptop.

Behind the scenes at Scary Fast: Apple’s keynote event shot on iPhone and edited on Mac
On Monday, October 30, at Apple’s Scary Fast special event unveiling the all-new MacBook Pro with the M3 family of chips and 24-inch iMac with M3, there was an unseen star of the show working behind the scenes. All of the presenters, locations, and drone footage in the event were filmed using iPhone 15 Pro Max, the preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers. Led by documentary film director Brian Oakes, known for the award-winningJim: The James Foley StoryandLiving with Lincoln, Scary Fast put iPhone 15 Pro Max right in the middle of the action.
The iPhone 15 Pro Max camera system offers the best video in a smartphone, with its quality rivaling those of professional video cameras. iPhone 15 Pro Max enables creatives to capture in ProRes up to 4K60 fps to an external drive with Apple Log encoding, which allows even more detail to be preserved for post-production color grading. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also the first smartphones in the world to support the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES), a global standard for color workflows.
“We were able to get the same complex shots with iPhone 15 Pro Max,” says Oakes. “Everything is there to be an extension of someone’s vision or personality. The image quality of iPhone definitely democratizes the access.”
The production was advised by Apple’s Jon Carr, a Pro Workflow video specialist whose credits includeTop Gun: MaverickandTerminator: Dark Fate, and Jeff Wozniak, who has worked on productions includingTransformers: Dark of the Moon,Avatar, andIron Man 2. “This year, iPhone 15 Pro Max was supercharged with the ability to record ProRes to an external drive, and Apple Log, our flavor of a format that all of the very high-end digital cameras shoot,” says Wozniak.
“It’s pretty amazing how you can put this in the hands of someone who’s a professional director and they don’t have to change their equipment — they don’t have to change any of the things that they always do,” adds Carr.
Capturing footage with multiple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices, the team utilized the integration between iPhone 15 Pro, theBlackmagic Cameraapp, and Tentacle Sync, showcasing the true power of the Apple ecosystem. Connected via Bluetooth, Tentacle Sync drives timecode and enables all devices on set — including Macs and preview screens — to be synced throughout the production. Beastgrip accessories, including cages and rigs, were also used during the production.
Here’s how Scary Fast came to life behind the scenes.
iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new USB-C connector brings a huge leap in data transfer with speeds of up to 10Gbps with a compatible USB 3 cable. This supports new workflows like ProRes video recording directly to an external SSD drive, allowing the crew to review footage in near real time and make adjustments on the fly. In post, editors can also take advantage of the higher dynamic range enabled with Apple Log, bringing even more control and flexibility into color grading.
Shot under the cover of night at Apple Park, Scary Fast showcased the improvements in low-light video performance on iPhone 15 Pro Max. With ProRes Log encoding, iPhone 15 Pro Max has even more high and low light range than previous models, resulting overall in better dynamic range and better flexibility for color grading in post-production. “When I first got the footage from iPhone 15 Pro Max, I was immediately pleasantly surprised,” says Stefan Sonnenfeld, Company 3’s CEO, who colored the presentation and has worked on projects includingStranger Things,The Equalizer 3, andFast X. “The quality of the image on iPhone 15 Pro Max is incredible, and it’s there. And I know because I’ve done it and I’ve seen it, and we’re doing this project with it.”
Using the Blackmagic Camera app designed exclusively for iOS users, the crew was able to leverage the same interface as Blackmagic Design’s award-winning digital film cameras, which provided the same tools used in feature films, television shows, and documentaries. Available now for free on the App Store, the app adds digital film camera controls to iPhone and supports Apple Log encoding on iPhone 15 Pro Max. “We’ve done a tremendous amount of work behind the scenes working with a great third-party developer, Blackmagic Design, that has created an incredible app that allows us to have huge amounts of monitors and crew, and everybody working how they traditionally would,” says Carr.
On the set, the crew employed traditional filming techniques — even the use of drones — seamlessly with iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture the scenes and showcase the new MacBook Pro. “There’s cranes, there’s dollies, there’s all the toys that you want as a filmmaker, and everybody’s moving and has their job to do, and it’s just a very exciting and lively environment,” says Oakes.
Reflecting on the incredible versatility and ease of use of iPhone, Sonnenfeld says, “I think what I love about the iPhone is it enables everybody who uses it to have access to incredible amounts of information, and with a really intuitive operating system, so that whether it’s myself or my 7-year-old, anybody can pick it up and pretty much use it right away.”

November 6, 2023
UPDATE
Final Cut Pro takes video editing on Mac and iPad to the next level with powerful new features
Latest updates streamline the editing process with improvements to timeline navigation, expanded in-app content, and voiceover recording
Today Apple announced updates to Final Cut Pro across Mac and iPad, offering powerful new features that help streamline workflows. Final Cut Pro now includes improvements in timeline navigation and organization, as well as new ways to simplify complex edits. The apps leverage the power-efficient performance of Apple silicon along with an all-new machine learning model for Object Tracker, and export speeds are turbocharged on Mac models powered by multiple media engines.1Final Cut Pro for iPad brings new features to further enhance the portable Multi-Touch editing experience, including support for voiceover recording, expanded in-app content options, added color-grading presets, and workflow improvements. These updates to Final Cut Pro will be available later this month on the App Store.
New in Final Cut Pro for Mac
The latest update to Final Cut Pro for Mac offers creators new tools for simplifying complex edits and turbocharged export speeds.
Powerful Organization Tools
To ensure that creators maintain their flow while editing complex timelines, Final Cut Pro introduces automatic timeline scrolling, making it easier for users to stay focused by keeping their clips in view under the playhead during playback. Editors can dynamically adjust their timeline view during playback by using the Zoom tool or keyboard shortcuts.
This update will also allow editors to see the organization of their timeline at a glance and easily differentiate clips by assigned role, improving the experience of viewing video and audio role colors. The distinct colors also let users identify and highlight clips by role using the timeline index.
Editors can now work more efficiently than ever by quickly cleaning up complex sections of the timeline, and can fine-tune the edit by combining a selected group of overlapping connected clips into a single connected storyline. To further streamline organization, editors can also combine connected clips with existing connected storylines.
More Optimization for Apple Silicon
Video professionals often work on multiple projects at once, and with this update, exporting these projects is now faster than ever. Users can speed up H.264 and HEVC exports by automatically sending video segments to available media engines for simultaneous processing.
Object tracking now offers a wide range of possibilities for creating remarkable effects with its all-new machine-learning model. Results are improved when using Object Tracker to analyze the movement of faces and other objects on Mac computers with Apple silicon. Final Cut Pro will choose the most suitable analysis when the analysis method is set to automatic.
New in Final Cut Pro for iPad
The latest update to Final Cut Pro for iPad delivers a powerful set of tools for video creators to record, edit, finish, and share, all from one device.
New Voiceover Capabilities
Adding live audio is even more convenient with this update. Creators can easily record narration and live audio directly in the timeline using the built-in microphones or external microphones on their iPad. Users can tap record as they play their timeline, or find the exact point where they want to start a voiceover and use a countdown to start.
Workflow Benefits
Users can now turn stabilization on in the pro camera mode to improve shaky footage for smoother videos, or turn it off to emphasize action and movement. Footage can be ingested directly into a project, so creators can start editing even faster with new enhancements such as connected storylines.
Creators can increase their efficiency by combining a selected group of connected clips or storylines and consolidating them into a single connected storyline. The new group command combines the power of the Magnetic Timeline with connected clips, and organizes the timeline.
New keyboard shortcuts for voiceover and grouping clips help further increase editing speed. Users can now finish their videos with a number of stunning new color-grading presets and a selection of new titles and generators to dial in the perfect look.
Final Cut Pro for iPad also supports the ability to import projects created in iMovie for iOS, and iPad users can export their Final Cut Pro projects to Mac for additional tools, like advanced color correction and expanded third-party content options.2

2023-11-06,Increase,Apple supercharges Logic Pro with powerful tools for music creation on Mac and iPad,"Text of this article
November 6, 2023
UPDATE
Apple supercharges Logic Pro with powerful tools for music creation on Mac and iPad
Features include a new Mastering Assistant, 32-bit recording, Sample Alchemy, and Beat Breaker on Mac; a Quick Sampler Recorder mode on iPad; and more
Today Apple updated Logic Pro with powerful new features available across Mac and iPad. With the new Mastering Assistant and its professional palette of intuitive sound-shaping tools, musicians can deliver a release-ready mix faster than ever. Logic Pro for Mac now gets incredible sample manipulation with Sample Alchemy, and the radical reshaping and reshuffling capabilities of Beat Breaker. Logic Pro for iPad offers even more powerful features, including Quick Sampler Recorder mode, which allows users to quickly capture “found sounds” using the built-in microphone in iPad and instantly create custom playable instruments. Producers and beat makers with their own collections of samples can quickly build kits or custom instruments using improved multitasking features such as Split View and Stage Manager. And users can work easily between Mac and iPad with project round-tripping, taking the music-making experience on the road or to the studio.
New Features Coming to Mac and iPad
Mastering Assistant offers creators a quick and easy way to add that final professional polish for a release-ready mix. Once a mix is complete, Mastering Assistant can instantly analyze the audio and make expert refinements to the sound, adjusting elements such as the dynamics, frequency balance, timbre, and loudness. Creators can also use Mastering Assistant’s initial processing as a starting point and then fine-tune each setting with intuitive controls, allowing for a mix that sounds great both in the car and in the club.
Logic Pro now supports 32-bit float recording when used with compatible audio interfaces. This helps artists minimize the digital clipping that can occur when recording more dynamic instruments or performances. With 32-bit float, even recordings made at lower levels can be easily amplified without increasing the noise floor, providing studio-quality audio and flexibility in post-production.
New in Logic Pro for Mac
Introduced on Logic Pro for iPad earlier this year, Sample Alchemy and Beat Breaker are now available in Logic Pro for Mac. Sample Alchemy allows users to transform a single audio sample into a playable instrument using a variety of techniques, including granular, additive, and spectral synthesis. Artists can now create a wide range of unique sound beds, pads, effects, and rhythms, pushing the boundaries of creativity.
With the Beat Breaker multieffect plug-in, creators can radically reshape and reshuffle audio in real time, slicing audio, rearranging it, and adding scratching effects. By altering the speed, direction, volume, and number of repeats for each slice, musicians can effortlessly define complex patterns that can be changed on the fly.
The Tools menu in the Tracks area and time-based editors now includes Slip and Rotate tools, enabling users to move content within audio and software instrument regions without altering the region boundaries.
Today’s update to Logic Pro for Mac introduces two new sound packs: The Hybrid Textures sound pack includes a collection of 70 patches, as well as over 80 Apple Loops featuring Sample Alchemy, while the Vox Melodics sound pack contains a diverse collection of over 475 lyrical phrases, hooks, layered harmonies, FX, and one-shots. Users can download all of the app’s free sound packs using the Sound Library.
New in Logic Pro for iPad
The Quick Sampler plug-in allows users to quickly create sampler instruments from virtually any sound. With the new Recorder mode, users can create instruments and drum kits by directly recording audio with the built-in microphone or a connected audio input, allowing for instrument creation to happen just about anywhere.
Now creators can move seamlessly between Logic Pro and other apps like Voice Memos or the Files app using Split View and Stage Manager. Split View allows users to open two different apps — or two windows from the same app — by splitting the screen into resizable views, while Stage Manager allows users to resize windows, see multiple overlapping windows in a single view or tap to switch between apps, and more.
Users can quickly find the perfect sound in the Browser by simply dragging up or down with a finger to preview multiple samples, loops, or instruments. Additionally, users can select and drag their own samples from the Files app to Logic Pro to easily build drum kits or add stems to a project.
Logic Pro adds to its popular in-app Lessons with additional instruction covering a broad range of topics, including Mastering Assistant, Sample Alchemy, Beat Breaker, beat making, automation, sound packs, and Play Surfaces. The Hybrid Textures sound packs also come to Logic Pro for iPad, offering creators new material to explore the power and depth of Sample Alchemy.

2023-11-08,Increase,Taylor Swift is Apple Music’s Artist of the Year for 2023,"Text of this article
November 8, 2023
UPDATE
Taylor Swift is Apple Music’s Artist of the Year for 2023
After a remarkable, record-breaking 2023, Taylor Swift is Apple Music’s Artist of the Year. Across the charts, streams, and concert stadiums filled with screaming, bracelet-wearing super fans, Swift undeniably reached a new realm of superstardom this year. All told, in the first 10 months of 2023, she saw 65 songs reach Apple Music’s Global Daily Top 100 — more than any other artist.
“I am so honored to be Apple Music’s Artist of the Year,” said Swift. “Thank you to every single one of you for making this year the most incredible, joyful, celebratory year ever. From streaming the music nonstop to screaming it together in real life at the shows, dancing chaotically in movie theaters, none of this would have been possible without you. Thank you so much.”
“Taylor Swift’s impact on music is absolutely undeniable — not just this record-breaking year, but throughout her entire career,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “She is a generation-defining artist and a true change agent in the music industry, and there is no doubt that her impact and influence will be felt for years to come. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to celebrate her achievements.”
Today, Apple Musicspotlightsthe music and moments that defined Taylor Swift’s Eras era — an event so culture-engulfing it turned songs from her past into some of the biggest of this year. Listeners can tune in to an array of radio programming celebrating Swift’s two decades’ worth of melodic album narratives, as well as interviews, album collections, and playlists that showcase the singer-songwriter’s journey leading up to this historic year. Tune in atapple.co/am-1.
2023 (Taylor’s Version) on Apple Music
As Apple Music’s Artist of the Year, Swift will also receive a physical award that represents the extraordinary craftsmanship integral to creating music. Each Apple Music Award features Apple’s custom silicon wafer suspended between a polished sheet of glass, and a machined and anodized aluminum body. In a symbolic gesture, the same chip powering the devices that put 100 million songs at listeners’ fingertips also sits at the very heart of the Apple Music Awards.

2023-11-08,Increase,Apple’s Swift Student Challenge to open in February 2024 with new Distinguished Winners category,"Text of this article
November 8, 2023
UPDATE
Apple’s Swift Student Challenge to open in February 2024 with new Distinguished Winners category
Introducing new Everyone Can Code resources to support educators in bringing app design and development to students
Apple’sSwift Student Challengehas given thousands of students around the world the opportunity to showcase their creativity and build real-world skills to take into their careers and beyond. Since 2020, students participating in the challenge have joined a worldwide community of developers using Swift — the same programming language used by professionals — to create the next wave of groundbreaking apps. The next challenge will open in February 2024, and will include a new category recognizing 50 Distinguished Winners, who will be named for standout submissions.
Interest among students who wish to learn coding and app development is widespread, and these skills are seen as highly desirable, whether students intend to work in the technology sector or not. In anindependent surveyof more than 1,000 students in the United States in September, researchers from YPulse found that 92 percent of students believe it is important to learn how to code and 94 percent believe coding is an important skill for the future job market. In addition, students recognize multiple benefits of knowing how to code and build apps, including boosting creativity, solving local and global problems, and ultimately making the world a better place.
Awareness of and access to coding and app development resources are critical for learners — while the survey found that 85 percent of students have not yet taken steps but would like to learn to code, 48 percent don’t know where to start. Apple’s Swift Playgrounds app was designed to take learners from their first line of code to building their first app in Swift. It’s a great tool for beginners to explore, learn, discover, and experiment with coding and app development on iPad and Mac.
“At Apple, we believe that everyone can learn to code and build apps, and we’re proud to support and recognize aspiring student developers with the Swift Student Challenge each year,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Education & Enterprise Marketing. “We know that students are eager to learn coding skills to solve challenges they care about — whether it’s building an app to help peers identify mental health resources or supporting sustainability efforts on campus — and want to know how to get started. Apple is releasing new coding resources for students and educators, working with our community partners on dedicated Swift programming, and sharing advance notice of the Swift Student Challenge timeline for 2024. We can’t wait to see the app playgrounds students submit next year.”
To help bring app development to learners, Apple works with educators around the globe. To support teaching Swift Playgrounds for educators, four new Everyone Can Code Projects provide step-by-step resources to guide students in developing essential skills while creating apps that solve problems they care about.
Tina Lewis is a seventh grade life sciences teacher with Montgomery Public Schools in Alabama, an Apple Learning Coach, and a new Apple Distinguished Educator from the class of 2023. She also runs a coding club at Brewbaker Middle School. “As a teacher, it’s important to create a safe space where my students can be heard,” said Lewis. “With coding, you can create that space literally, while sparking students’ curiosity and building resilience in the face of failure.”
Lewis taught herself to code in 2021 using the Everyone Can Code educator resources and Swift Playgrounds on iPad alongside her students. One of her students went on to participate in the Swift Student Challenge in 2022. “I’m motivated by my students’ creativity and being the type of teacher that can turn on that light for my kids,” said Lewis.
In addition to working with educators worldwide, Apple supports learners in 99 countries and regions through its Community Education Initiative, such as the National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3). NC3 provides hands-on professional development opportunities to prepare community and technical college and high school instructors to teach App Development with Swift. This year, the organization is committing to helping more students than ever submit their app projects for the Swift Student Challenge in 2024.
“The Swift Student Challenge is a stepping stone for young talent, and we're building a pathway for their success,” said Roger Tadajewski, NC3’s executive director. “App Development with Swift training equips faculty with the skills to guide students, fostering an environment where curiosity is celebrated, creativity is encouraged, and every idea is given the opportunity to flourish.”
New Everyone Can Code Projects
Apple’s new Everyone Can Code Projects provide step-by-step resources to help educators guide students through every step of their coding and app development journey, and develop essential skills while creating apps that solve problems they care about.
Everyone Can Code Projects can be integrated into any subject area, and are perfect for the classroom or coding clubs. They introduce students to SwiftUI — the modern way to build user interfaces with surprisingly little code — and use the latest app-building technologies in Swift Playgrounds. As they code, students can see how their app changes in real time with App Preview.
Four new Projects available today include:
Everyone Can Code Projects with Swift Playgrounds make it easier than ever to teach and learn coding, app design, and app development on iPad and Mac — perfect for moments that celebrate coding skills around the world this season, including STEAM Day today in the U.S., as well as Computer Science Education Week and Hour of Code in December, celebrated across 180 countries and regions.
New resources for teaching coding and app development with Swift Playgrounds, including four new Everyone Can Code Projects, are now available in theApple Education Community, where educators can find resources for any skill level, connect with peers, and more. Swift Playgrounds 4.4 is available now, and includes support for Swift 5.9, and SDKs for iPadOS 17 and macOS Sonoma.
Students will be invited to submit their app playgrounds for the Swift Student Challenge during a three-week window in February 2024. Sign up atdeveloper.apple.comto be notified when the challenge is open. Out of 350 overall winners, 50 Distinguished Winners will be invited to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, California, next summer, where they’ll have the opportunity to connect with each other and the Apple team. All winners will receive a one-year membership into the Apple Developer Program, which enables them to submit apps to the App Store and receive support from Apple.

New iPhone photography exhibition debuts in Paris on November 10
The event held at the Salon Corderie features work from five esteemed photographers, all shot on iPhone
“I Remember You,” a photography exhibition opening in Paris on Friday, November 10, will highlight original work shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max celebrating the intersection of photography and nostalgia. The collective work of esteemed artists Malin Fezehai, Karl Hab, Vivien Liu, Mika Ninagawa, and Stefan Ruiz incorporates people, places, and things that move them, exploring the transience of their most precious memories and the power of photography to preserve them. And in doing so, they showcase the utility, ease of use, and image quality enabled by the impressive capabilities of the camera system on their iPhone 15 Pro Max.
“‘I Remember You’ brings together five photographers who share their deeply personal conceptions of memory, connection, and nostalgia,” explains Isolde Brielmaier, Ph.D., the exhibition’s curatorial advisor. “It is a moving glimpse of life, preserved in time.”
A picture has the power to both preserve and amplify a memory. It can transport people to a moment in time, evoke a feeling, and reveal new perspectives in a nearly universal visual language. And with iPhone 15 Pro users having access to a professional camera in their pocket — with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and an all-new 5x Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture stunning detail from afar, as well as a 48MP Main camera that offers a new super-high-resolution 24MP default with incredible image quality — everyone around the world is empowered to document their experiences.
In celebration of the opening, each artist spoke about how iPhone has contributed to their creative process and what they hope people will remember from their featured work.
Malin Fezehai is an Eritrean/Swedish photographer, filmmaker, and visual reporter currently living in New York. She has worked in over 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and America. Fezehai is aNational Geographicexplorer, and in 2023, she became a Climate Pledge grantee. She is working on a project about adaptation to living on water. Her career started in her native Sweden, where she studied photography before attending the International Center of Photography in New York. Her work focuses on communities of displacement and dislocation around the world. She was commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme to photograph survivors of violent extremism across sub-Saharan Africa and published a book titledSurvivors. She has received a 2015 World Press Photo Award and the Wallis Annenberg Prize, and was named one of the “30 Emerging Photographers to Watch” in 2015 byPhoto District News. Her image depicting a wedding of Eritrean refugees in Israel was the first iPhone photo ever to receive a World Press Photo Award.
“The integration of the iPhone into my photography workflow marked a significant shift in how I perceive and capture the world around me — feeling more inclined to capture life as it happens — the fleeting, candid moments that often define the human experience,” Fezehai says. “Its ease of use and ability to capture high-quality images effortlessly enables me to explore and document the ordinary in extraordinary ways. That sentiment is embodied in the work I created for the show.”
Karl Hab, born in 1990 and currently residing in Paris, is a well-established photographer who also holds a certification as an aeronautics engineer. When he’s not on the move, Hab’s passions for aviation, design, art, and fashion come to the forefront. His frequent travel allows him to immerse himself in international fashion and street culture, which serve as inspiration for his personal projects. A true wanderer at heart, Hab has been capturing the world through his lens for over 15 years, and there’s no sign of him slowing down. His natural inclination leads him toward action-packed moments, and with his new iPhone 15 Pro Max, his work has gained a new perspective.
“Shooting with iPhone is like having a third hand that could capture exactly what I wanted when I wanted,” Hab says. “I know I can rely on iPhone to precisely match what I see on the screen. And with this recent model, the 5x lens made me see things differently. You can truly push the limits of the device and showcase a different perspective on your work.”
Vivien Liu is a photographer based in Hong Kong. She received her Master of Architecture degree at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design, where she was awarded the prestigious Clifford Wong Prize in Housing Design. After 15 years in architecture, Liu discovered a passion for photographing the urban scenes of Hong Kong and other cities around the world. Because of her professional background, she is known for portraying space and subjects with a trained architectural eye. The synergy between people and space is a consistent theme in her work, which has brought an international spotlight on the cultural identity of Hong Kong, highlighting its architecture, people, and natural landscape.
“iPhone first became an integral part of my process when I started traveling and snapping scenes from my journeys,” Liu recalls. “I’ve come to rely on it for my commercial work at various stages in the creative process with its wide array of focal lengths and shooting modes. The 5x lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max was indispensable when trying to zero in on the details and textures of the aged buildings around me. Combined with the abundance of natural lighting, I was able to create images that are full of contrast between light and shadow.”
Mika Ninagawa is a Tokyo-based multidisciplinary artist who works in photography and film. In 2020, she published her photo book,TOKYO. The appeal of her photography can best be summed up by a signature approach that is bathed in vivid, dreamlike colors. Whether it is portraiture, landscape, or still life, at the heart of her work are themed looks that rotate between flora, fauna, landscapes, and empowered women to create Ninagawa’s lush tableaux. Ninagawa is one of Japan’s most celebrated photographers. Her retrospective, “Mika Ninagawa: Into Fiction / Reality,” opened at Beijing Times Art Museum in spring 2022.
Stefan Ruiz is based in Brooklyn, New York. He has taught art at San Quentin State Prison in California and was the creative director atCOLORSmagazine. His work has appeared in publications such asThe New York Times Magazine,The New Yorker,Vogue, andTIME. His photographs have been exhibited at International Center of Photography Museum in New York, the Photographers’ Gallery in London, Les Rencontres d’Arles, PHotoEspaña, Havana Biennial, and the CONTACT Photography Festival in Toronto. He has published four monographs, includingThe Factory of Dreams, a book on Mexican soap operas published by Aperture in 2012, andMexican Crime Photographs, published by GOST Books in 2016.
“The iPhone is able to make my shoots feel less formal, which helps make the subjects feel comfortable,” Ruiz says. “When they’re able to pass the phone around to see and comment on the images, it makes the whole process feel more collaborative.”
“I Remember You” will be on display at the Salon Corderie in Le Marais in Paris on Friday, November 10, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

2023-11-30,Increase,Apple announces expanded partnership with Amkor for advanced silicon packaging in the U.S.,"Text of this article
November 30, 2023
UPDATE
Apple announces expanded partnership with Amkor for advanced silicon packaging in the U.S.
Today Apple announced it will be the first and largest customer of the new Amkor manufacturing and packaging facility being developed in Peoria, Arizona. Amkor will package Apple silicon produced at the nearby TSMC fab, where Apple is also the largest customer.
“Apple is deeply committed to the future of American manufacturing, and we’ll continue to expand our investment here in the United States,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple silicon has unlocked new levels of performance for our users, enabling them to do things they could never do before, and we are thrilled that Apple silicon will soon be produced and packaged in Arizona.”
Apple and Amkor have worked together for more than a decade, packaging chips used extensively in all Apple products. With a shared desire to manufacture in the U.S., Apple and Amkor developed plans to build the largest outsourced advanced packaging facility in America. Amkor will invest approximately $2 billion in the project, and upon completion, it will employ more than 2,000 people.
Apple’s investments in advanced manufacturing are part of the commitment the company made in 2021 to invest $430 billion in the U.S. economy over five years. Today Apple is on pace to meet its target through direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the U.S., and other domestic spend.

2023-11-30,Increase,A disability advocate preserves his voice with iPhone,"When you have something that is so precious, ataonga— a treasure — I think we should do anything we can to make sure we keep hold of that.
Tristram Ingham, senior research fellow, University of Otago, Wellington’s Department of Medicine
Text of this article
November 30, 2023
UPDATE
A disability advocate preserves his voice with iPhone
For physician and disability advocate Tristram Ingham, Apple’s new speech accessibility features provide reassurance amid an uncertain future
When introducing himself, Tristram Ingham often begins with a te reo Māori greeting before breaking into English. The New Zealand-native has a voice that’s kind, soft, and sure, with every word carefully chosen and placed. As a physician, academic researcher, and disability community leader, Ingham’s words are his power.
Ingham has facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), which causes progressive muscle degeneration starting in the face, shoulders, and arms, and can ultimately lead to the inability to speak, feed oneself, or in some cases, blink the eyes. In 2013, he began using a wheelchair, and in recent years he has noticed changes in his voice.
“I find that by the end of a long day, just bringing up my voice gets a bit harder,” he says, recounting a recent, frustrating incident: “I had to give a conference presentation just last month, and it turned out that, on the day, I wasn’t able to deliver it because of my breathing. So I had to get someone else to present for me, even though I had written it.”
In the future, it is possible Ingham may not be able to use his speaking voice at all. “I’m very aware on a professional level that using my voice is getting harder. I am aware that when I get more fatigued, I get quieter, harder to understand,” he says, noting the cognitive dissonance of a progressive condition. “But on a human level, I put that out of my mind, because what can one do about it?”
This fall, Apple launched its new Personal Voice feature, available with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma. With Personal Voice, users at risk of speech loss can create a voice that sounds like them by following a series of text prompts to capture 15 minutes of audio. Apple has long been at the forefront of neural text-to-speech technology. With Personal Voice, Apple is able to train neural networks entirely on-device to advance speech accessibility while protecting users’ privacy.
“Disability communities are very mindful of proxy voices speaking on our behalf,” Ingham says. “Historically, providers have spoken for disabled people, family have spoken for disabled people. If technology can allow a voice to be preserved and maintained, that’s autonomy, that’s self-determination.”
Ingham created his Personal Voice for Apple’s “The Lost Voice,” in which he uses his iPhone to read alouda new children’s bookof the same name created for International Day of Persons with Disabilities. When he tried the feature for the first time, Ingham was surprised to find how easy it was to create, and how much it sounded like him.
“It was really straightforward, I was quite relieved,” he says, remarking on the voice coming from his iPhone: “I’m really pleased to hear it in my voice with my style of speaking, rather than an American voice, or an Australian voice or a U.K. voice.”
Live Speech, another speech accessibility feature Apple released this fall, offers users the option to type what they want to say and have the phrase spoken aloud, whether it is in their Personal Voice or in any built-in system voice. Users with physical, motor, and speech disabilities can communicate in the way that feels most natural and comfortable for them by combining Live Speech with features like Switch Control and AssistiveTouch, which offer alternatives to interacting with their device using physical touch.
“Technology can be critical for preserving one’s own natural-sounding voice,” says Blair Casey, executive director of the nonprofit Team Gleason. The organization supports individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), another progressive condition which causes speech loss in 1 of every 3 individuals diagnosed. “Our voices are part of our identity,” says Casey, “When diseases like ALS threaten to take away the ability to speak, tools like Personal Voice can help anyone continue to sound like their unique, authentic self.”
“At Apple, we design for everyone, and that includes individuals with disabilities,” says Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “Communication is a crucial part of what makes us human, and we’re committed to supporting nonspeaking users as well as those who may be at risk of speech loss.”
For Ingham, Personal Voice is just one of many tools that allows him to keep doing what he loves.
“I’m not prepared to just sit at home,” Ingham says. “I work, I volunteer in the community, and I expect to contribute meaningfully. Technology helps me to do that.”
Ingham’s professional accomplishments include credit for originating the widely used epidemiological concept of the COVID bubble, which he first proposed as a way to protect people with disabilities and weakened immune systems early in the pandemic. He also serves as chairman of the national representative body for disabled Māori, and advises New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, which complements his work as a senior research fellow at the University of Otago, Wellington’s Department of Medicine.
Perhaps most important, though, is keeping a personal connection with friends and family, regardless of the state of his speaking voice.
“I’ve got three grandchildren,” he says. “I love to read them bedtimestories. They come and stay the night quite often, and they love stories about sea creatures, tsunamis, things like that. And I just want to be able to ensure that I can keep doing that into the future.”
“You never know what is going to happen,” he continues, “and when you have something that is so precious, ataonga —a treasure — I think we should do anything we can to make sure we keep hold of that.”

Stephanie Wittels Wachs, Lemonada Media’s co-founder and chief creative officer
Text of this article
December 5, 2023
UPDATE
Apple Podcasts namesWiser Than Methe 2023 Show of the Year
Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Lemonada Media’s founders reflect on a standout first season
At the outset ofWiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfusfrom Lemonada Media, Hollywood legend Jane Fonda recalled the sudden revelation she had on the eve of her 59th birthday: that she was entering her life’s third and final act.
“You know how important third acts are,” Fonda, now 85, told host Julia Louis-Dreyfus early on in the episode. “They can make sense out of the first two, right? They’re very important — it’s kind of a legacy that you’re going to leave behind.”
Right out of the gate,Wiser Than Meattracted a massive audience on Apple Podcasts, spending 29 days straight as the No. 1 show in the U.S. overall — a feat that has yet to be topped in 2023.
Apple is proud to celebrateWiser Than Me with Julia Louis-Dreyfuswith the Apple Podcasts Award, a recognition given each year to honor a show that demonstrates quality and innovation in podcasting. The show’s popularity and accolades are a testament to its refreshingly authentic approach to amplifying the voices of older, wiser women — a demographic not often centered in mainstream culture — and encouraging intergenerational listening.
Over the course of the show’s 10-episode debut season, accomplished actor and comedian Louis-Dreyfus employs her signature wit to mine priceless nuggets of advice from women who have lived long enough and well enough to truly have perspective on it all.
Beginning a new chapter of her own at 62, the first-time podcast host brings personalities like singer Darlene Love, 82, and author Amy Tan, 71, to the microphone for far-ranging conversations that evoke laughter, tears, and just about every emotion in between.
“All of these women have demonstrated how to live a life,” Louis-Dreyfus says of her guests. “That doesn’t mean they didn’t make mistakes, but there’s something about being older where perhaps you feel not as protective in terms of sharing. And so I’ve taken advantage of the intimacy that offers. That availability to be real and to be open is a great gift.”
A big part ofWiser Than Me’s appeal is Louis-Dreyfus’s willingness to be playful and stretch the bounds of the typical interview-podcast format, explains Stephanie Wittels Wachs, cofounder and chief creative officer of Lemonada Media, the podcast’s home network. “Julia never wants to have a typical conversation,” she says. “She wants to play and weave and bob, and do all the fun things that you expect from something unexpected.”
Lemonada cofounder and CEO Jessica Cordova Kramer credits the accessibility of Apple Podcasts with helping the show reach new audiences. “Apple does a great job of showcasing diverse shows of different kinds, following whatever’s happening in the world and helping people discover new things — not just the most popular things,” explains Cordova Kramer. “We love our Lemonada Premium channel because we have a big slate of shows now, and for us, that has been a huge translator of audience overlap.”
After its wildly successful first season,Wiser Than Meis gearing up for more — Lemonada recently announced a second season set to premiere in spring 2024.
The show’s organic flow and off-the-cuff structure are best exemplified by a moment a mere 15 minutes into that very first episode where a bomb cyclone interrupts Louis-Dreyfus’s Zoom connection, forcing her to reschedule the rest of the interview with Fonda. Instead of editing the mishap out in post-production, the podcast leans into the moment, taking listeners behind the scenes as Louis-Dreyfus’s recorder continues to roll.
“That’s why the show is so real. You’re dealing with somebody like Julia, who’s so well known and beloved, but her internet goes out, and it offered this amazing peek behind the curtains,” Wittels Wachs says. “I think having that as episode one made it so accessible for listeners, and that energy just kept going throughout the series.”
No topic is off-limits for the show’s guests, who gamely approach the mic with an unguarded vulnerability as they discuss their highest highs and their lowest lows, along with weighty topics like sex, divorce, politics, sexism in the workplace, death, and the physical realities of aging.
“The magic of it is that Julia is open about her own journey in ways she never had been before, so you are getting this sort of reciprocity,” adds Cordova Kramer. (During the show’s first season, Louis-Dreyfus opened up with guests about her struggle after losing a pregnancy, as well as her experience being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017.)
The Lemonada team explains that the medium of podcasting lent itself especially well to the kind of conversations Louis-Dreyfus was interested in having. “These women don’t need to worry about hair and makeup,” says Cordova Kramer. “They can log on from their bedrooms, their hotel rooms — wherever they are in their busy lives — and they can have this beautiful conversation with this incredible interviewer that is way less guarded and allows for much more authenticity.”
One especially memorable moment for Louis-Dreyfus was sitting down for a conversation with one of her lifelong comedy influences for the season’s final episode.
“Carol Burnett was a huge part of my life growing up in a way, without me even realizing she was a huge part of my life,” Louis-Dreyfus explains. “She was a part of the fabric of our culture. And as a woman, she really modeled a female power that sort of got into my bones without my even realizing it.”
With its unapologetic, raw discussions,Wiser Than Meis inspiring people in their 20s, 30s, and beyond to rethink their attitudes toward getting older.
“There’s a lot of fear around aging, and I think the podcast is making people excited about it. It’s making it less scary. It’s making it accessible,” says Wittels Wachs. “There’s tangible wisdom that we hope people will take away from it. And then there’s that inspirational wisdom people are getting that’s just like, ‘Oh, aging. Oh my god — that’s awesome. I want to do that. I want to be like these women.’”
Often, some of the show’s most heart-warming moments come courtesy of the post-interview epilogue where Louis-Dreyfus calls her mother Judith, 89, to debrief and continue the conversation.
“Judith is a gem — a priceless gem. She’s incredible, and she’s everyone’s favorite,” Wittels Wachs says. “Julia is just eating it up, and so is Judith. I think it really is encouraging a kind of intergenerational dialogue. And that’s really what we wanted — for women in their 20s to talk to their mothers and their grandmothers about their experiences.”

UPDATE
Report: 2.6 billion personal records compromised by data breaches in past two years — underscoring need for end‑to‑end encryption
An Apple-commissioned study shows that threats to consumer data stored in the cloud have grown dramatically since the last report was published in December 2022
Today Apple published an independent study conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Dr. Stuart Madnick that found clear and compelling proof that data breaches have become an epidemic, threatening sensitive and personal consumer data the world over. The total number of data breaches more than tripled between 2013 and 2022 — exposing 2.6 billion personal records in the past two years alone — and has continued to get worse in 2023. The findings underscore that strong protections against data breaches in the cloud, like end-to-end encryption, have only grown more essential since last year’s report and the launch of Advanced Data Protection for iCloud.
This year’s study, “The Continued Threat to Personal Data: Key Factors Behind the 2023 Increase,” demonstrates threats that had already reached historic levels — as shown in last year’s report, ""The Rising Threat to Consumer Data in the Cloud"" — continue to rise. Increasingly, companies across the technology industry are addressing these threats by implementing end-to-end encryption, as Apple did with last year’s launch of Advanced Data Protection for iCloud.
With Advanced Data Protection for iCloud, which uses end-to-end encryption to provide Apple’s highest level of cloud data security, users have the choice to further protect important iCloud data even in the case of a data breach. iCloud already protects 14 sensitive data categories using end-to-end encryption by default, including passwords in iCloud Keychain and Health data. For users who enable Advanced Data Protection for iCloud, the total number of data categories protected using end-to-end encryption rises to 23, including iCloud Backup, Notes, and Photos.
“Bad actors continue to pour enormous amounts of time and resources into finding more creative and effective ways to steal consumer data, and we won’t rest in our efforts to stop them,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “As threats to consumer data grow, we’ll keep finding ways to fight back on behalf of our users by adding even more powerful protections.”
As shown in this year’s report, the increasing digitalization of users’ personal and professional lives has fueled a dramatic rise in data breaches. Each year, thousands of data breaches expose the personal information of hundreds of millions of consumers. Hackers are evolving their methods and finding more ways to defeat security practices that once held them back. Consequently, even organizations with the strongest possible security practices are vulnerable to threats in a way that wasn’t true just a few years ago.
The report also shows that even when consumers take all the right steps to secure their sensitive data, it’s still at risk of being compromised by hackers if it’s stored in a readable form by organizations they entrust it with. For instance, when attempting to infiltrate companies with robust security practices, hackers often start by targeting a different organization with relatively weak security that has a technical business relationship with the ultimate target. They then steal credentials or information that helps them target employees or systems at the organization that is their primary objective.
As threats to user data continue to grow more frequent and sophisticated, Apple’s long track record of engineering powerful and innovative features make its products the most secure on the market. With Lockdown Mode, Apple developed a protection for those who may be targeted by extreme threats like mercenary spyware because of who they are or what they do. Apple’s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud is another feature the company has developed to protect users against growing threats to their data, keeping most user data in iCloud protected even in the case of a data breach in the cloud.
The report illustrates that the historic threats to user data that saw the number of data breaches nearly triple between 2013 and 2022, compromising 2.6 billion records over the course of two years, are only getting worse in 2023. In the U.S. alone, there were nearly 20 percent more breaches in just the first nine months of 2023 than in any prior year. The target for cybercriminals was very clear, with a 2023 survey finding that over 80 percent of breaches involved data stored in the cloud. This is after attacks targeting cloud infrastructure nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022.
This is due in part to the increased targeting of consumer data by ransomware gangs and coordinated campaigns that compromised vendors or their products to target customers. The threat of ransomware has only grown in 2023, as shown by the fact that there were nearly 70 percent more attacks reported through September 2023 than in the first three quarters of 2022. In fact, experts found that there were more ransomware attacks through September 2023 than in all of 2022 combined. This has led to alarming trends in the U.S. and abroad, with more than double the accounts getting breached in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 in the U.K., Australia, and Canada combined.

UPDATE
Redesigned Apple TV app elevates the viewing experience
The intuitive new interface lets users more easily browse and watch Apple Original series and films, as well as live sports, movies, and more
Today Apple unveiled a redesigned Apple TV app that makes it even easier for users to watch Apple’s award-winning original series and films, as well as live sports, movies, and television shows across their favorite Apple devices, smart TVs, streaming sticks, gaming consoles, and more. The simplified interface’s new sidebar allows users to quickly navigate the app, providing easy access to Apple TV+, home of Apple Original series and films; MLS Season Pass, home of Major League Soccer; Store, where users can buy and rent popular movies; and shortcuts to channels and apps viewers already have, such as Disney+, Paramount+, and Max.
“The redesigned Apple TV app makes it easier than ever for users to watch the shows, movies, and sports they love through an intuitive interface that brings content to the forefront,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “With so much available to watch, our aim is to ensure users always have their favorites at their fingertips.”
The new sidebar navigation also introduces Home, a unified guide for all the shows, movies, and sports viewers love. Within Home, the Channels & Apps section allows users to browse each of their subscribed channels or connected apps in depth. And collections — including New Shows & Movies, Top Charts, Trending, and For You — bring forward the best recommendations for viewers to enjoy across what’s new, popular, and tailored just for them.
On living room devices, the sidebar will also feature profiles, allowing households to quickly switch between users for better personalization in Up Next and content recommendations across the app.
The updated Store tab in the Apple TV app unifies movies and TV shows into one offering, so users can more easily access everything available to buy or rent, and a new Add Channels & Apps shelf where users can explore popular streaming services.
Also starting today, the iTunes Store app on iPhone and iPad, and the iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps on Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD, will redirect users to the Apple TV app, where they can find their existing purchases and watch all of their favorite TV shows and movies in one place.

UPDATE
Apple introduces spatial video capture on iPhone 15 Pro
With iOS 17.2, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max users can now record spatial videos — a groundbreaking new capability that helps users capture life’s precious moments — and relive those memories on Apple Vision Pro, starting early next year.
“iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature the most powerful camera systems we’ve ever developed, including the best video quality in any smartphone,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “And now, we’re setting a new bar for what’s possible, enabling users to record special moments just as they happened. Spatial videos are magical, and we can’t wait for users to experience them on Apple Vision Pro early next year.”
Enable Spatial Video Capture on iPhone
Once spatial video capture is enabled in Settings, users can leverage the advanced camera systems on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture their favorite moments in three dimensions. Spatial videos are captured in 1080p at 30 frames per second in standard dynamic range. With advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max deliver stunning spatial memories in a compact file size.1
Capturing Great Spatial Videos
Capturing spatial videos on iPhone is as easy as capturing regular videos on iPhone: With the Camera app open in Video mode, rotate iPhone to landscape orientation, tap the spatial video icon, and then tap record. iPhone starts recording video from both the advanced Main and Ultra Wide cameras, and scales the field of view from the Ultra Wide camera to match that of the Main camera, which is then saved into a single video file.
Viewing Spatial Videos
On iPhone and other devices, spatial videos appear as regular, 2D videos and can be watched or shared just like any other video using apps like Messages. Users can find all of the spatial videos they capture within a new Spatial album in the Photos app, and all of their spatial videos will sync across their devices with iCloud.
Spatial videos come to life on Apple Vision Pro. With iCloud, users will be able to access their entire library in the Photos app and view their videos at life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail. On Apple Vision Pro, spatial videos can be played back in a window or expanded into an immersive view that transports users back to each moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering.
Spatial video capture on iPhone arrives ahead of the debut of Apple Vision Pro, so iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max users can begin capturing moments with family and friends to enjoy on Apple Vision Pro from day one.

December 11, 2023
UPDATE
Apple launches Journal, a new app to reflect on everyday moments and life’s special events
Journal, a new iPhone app available today, helps users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, which has been shown to improve wellbeing. With Journal, users can capture and write about everyday moments and special events in their lives, and include photos, videos, audio recordings, locations, and more to create rich memories. On-device machine learning provides private, personalized suggestions to inspire journal entries, and customizable notifications help users develop their writing habits. With the new Journaling Suggestions API, third-party journaling apps can also suggest moments for users to write about. Journal and the Journaling Suggestions API are available with the release of iOS 17.2.
“We are excited to bring the benefits of journaling to more people,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “Journal makes it easy to preserve rich and powerful memories, and practice gratitude by intelligently curating information that is personal to the user, right from their iPhone. And we’re making it possible for other journaling apps to offer the same personalized suggestions while maintaining the highest level of privacy.”
Capturing Life’s Moments
With Journal, it’s easy to get started by logging a simple text entry, or adding rich details like photos, videos, locations, or audio recordings to add more context. It’s just as easy to add content like a news article, music, or a podcast from other apps by bringing it into the Journal app and writing about it. Users can browse past entries, bookmark them, or filter for details like photos, workouts, places, and more. Scheduled notifications can help make journaling a consistent practice.
Personalized Suggestions and Reflection Prompts
Intelligently curated personalized suggestions are designed to help users remember and write about a moment — like new places they’ve visited, photos they’ve taken, songs they’ve played, workouts they’ve completed, and more. Suggestions based on user activity include writing prompts to empower meaningful insights, and daily reflection prompts help users focus on gratitude, kindness, purpose, and more. Users control the type of content that appears in Suggestions and can create a journal entry with the Suggestions they choose.
In addition, developers can use the new Journaling Suggestions API to add personalized journaling suggestions to their apps, prompting users with moments to write about in a privacy-preserving way, so more people can benefit from journaling and the personalized, secure experience only iPhone can deliver.
“The Journal app is an exciting development for us because it introduces the benefits of digital journaling to a wider audience and ushers in a new chapter for the practice,” said Paul Mayne, founder of the journaling app Day One. “We have integrated the Journaling Suggestions API into the Day One app to give our users an even richer experience that puts privacy at the forefront, and we can’t wait for them to try it.”
Keeping Entries Personal and Private
Journal is built with privacy at its core. When iPhone is locked with a passcode, entries in the Journal app are encrypted. Additionally, users can choose to enable secondary authentication, and lock the Journal app with their device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID. All Journal entries are end-to-end encrypted when stored in iCloud, so that no one but the user can access them. Journaling suggestions are created on device, and users can choose which suggested moments are shared with the Journal app and added to their Journal entries.

Apple Fitness+ is introducing new ways for users to stay active and mindful in the new year. Starting Monday, January 8, the service will introduce a brand-new sound meditation theme, as well as a new workout program titled Strength, Core, and Yoga for Golfers, featuring record-breaking athlete Rose Zhang, known as one of golf’s rising stars.

For the first time ever, select Time to Walk episodes will be available on Apple Podcasts for anyone to enjoy in the 21 countries where the service is available, even without a Fitness+ subscription.
“Starting the new year can mean kicking off a fitness and wellbeing journey, restarting after a long break, or looking to take it up a level with a new challenge,” said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of Fitness Technologies. “From sound meditations to help you relax, to building strength for an improved golf swing, or turning up the volume on your workouts, Fitness+ has something for everyone to help them stay active and support their wellbeing in the new year.”

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Vision Pro available in the U.S. on February 2
The era of spatial computing is here — pre-orders begin Friday, January 19
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced Apple Vision Pro will be available beginning Friday, February 2, at all U.S. Apple Store locations and the U.S. Apple Store online. Vision Pro is a revolutionary spatial computer that transforms how people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, and enjoy entertainment. Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world and unlocks powerful spatial experiences in visionOS, controlled by the most natural and intuitive inputs possible — a user’s eyes, hands, and voice. An all-new App Store provides users with access to more than 1 million compatible apps across iOS and iPadOS, as well as new experiences that take advantage of the unique capabilities of Vision Pro. Pre-orders for Apple Vision Pro begin Friday, January 19, at 5 a.m. PST.
“The era of spatial computing has arrived,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.”
A Revolutionary Operating System and User Interface
Apple Vision Pro is powered by visionOS, which is built on the foundation of decades of engineering innovation in macOS, iOS, and iPadOS. visionOS delivers powerful spatial experiences, unlocking new opportunities at work and at home. Featuring a brand-new three-dimensional user interface and input system controlled entirely by a user’s eyes, hands, and voice, navigation feels magical. Intuitive gestures allow users to interact with apps by simply looking at them, tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using a virtual keyboard or dictation to type. With Siri, users can quickly open or close apps, play media, and more.
Users can also immerse themselves in Environments — dynamic, beautiful landscapes like Haleakalā, Joshua Tree, and Yosemite national parks, and even the surface of the moon — to help them focus or reduce clutter in busy spaces. With Environments, a user’s world can grow beyond the dimensions of a physical room. With a twist of the Digital Crown, users can control how present or immersed they are in an environment.
Extraordinary Experiences
Apple Vision Pro brings a new dimension to powerful, personal computing by changing the way users interact with their apps. The three-dimensional interface frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale, providing the ultimate workspace and creating an infinite canvas for multitasking and collaborating.
Since visionOS leverages existing developer frameworks, more than 1 million familiar apps across iOS and iPadOS are available on Apple Vision Pro and automatically work with the new input system. Vision Pro also has an all-new App Store where users can find apps that deliver spatial computing experiences unlike any other platform. Apps can be arranged anywhere and scaled to the perfect size, all while allowing the user to stay present in their space.
Memories Brought to Life
Apple Vision Pro enables users to capture and relive their favorite memories in entirely new ways. Spatial photos and videos transport users back to a special moment in time, and Spatial Audio makes the experience incredibly immersive. When users are on the go, they can capture spatial video on their iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and relive them on Vision Pro. Users can also view all their photos and videos at a life-size scale with brilliant color and spectacular detail, including Panoramas that expand and wrap around the user, making them feel like they are right where it was taken.
FaceTime Becomes Spatial
FaceTime on Apple Vision Pro takes advantage of the space around the user so that everyone on a call appears life-size, while Spatial Audio makes it sound like each person’s voice comes from the location of their tile. If a user is wearing Vision Pro while on FaceTime, they appear as their Persona, while others joining from a Mac, iPad, or iPhone will appear in a tile.
Persona is an authentic spatial representation of an Apple Vision Pro user that enables others on a call to see their facial expressions and hand movements — all in real time.2Using machine learning techniques, a Persona can be created in just minutes using Vision Pro. Personas also work in third-party videoconferencing apps including Zoom, Cisco Webex, and Microsoft Teams.
Breakthrough Design
Apple Vision Pro builds on Apple innovation and experience designing high-performance products like Mac, iPhone, and wearables like Apple Watch, culminating in the most advanced personal electronics device ever. An astonishing amount of technology is packed into a beautiful, compact design that utilizes the most advanced materials possible to achieve ambitious goals for performance, mobility, and wearability.
Apple Vision Pro is designed as a modular system so users can personalize their fit. A singular piece of three-dimensionally formed, laminated glass gently curves around the user’s face and flows into the custom aluminum alloy frame. The Light Seal is made of a soft textile and comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to a user’s face for a precise fit. Flexible straps ensure audio remains close to the user’s ears, while the included Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band allow users to find the optimal fit for them. For those with vision correction needs, ZEISS Optical Inserts are available with a prescription or as readers that magnetically attach to Vision Pro, allowing users to take full advantage of the display’s incredible sharpness and clarity.3
Unrivaled Innovation
Apple Vision Pro is designed to deliver phenomenal compute performance in a compact wearable form factor. Featuring a breakthrough ultra-high-resolution display system built on top of Apple silicon, Vision Pro uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, with wide color and high dynamic range. This technological breakthrough, combined with custom lenses that enable incredible sharpness and clarity, and advanced Spatial Audio, delivers jaw-dropping experiences.
Apple Vision Pro also features a high-performance eye tracking system that uses high-speed cameras and a ring of LEDs that project invisible light patterns onto the user’s eyes for responsive, intuitive input. And to help the user stay connected to the people around them, Apple designed a groundbreaking new feature called EyeSight. When a person approaches someone wearing Vision Pro, the device looks transparent — letting the user see them while also displaying the user’s eyes. When a user is immersed in an Environment or using an app, EyeSight gives visual cues to others about what the user is focused on.
The breakthrough display, advanced audio experiences, high-performance eye tracking system, and more are powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. The M2 chip delivers powerful standalone performance, while the brand-new R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user’s eyes.
Privacy and Security at Its Core
Apple Vision Pro offers industry-leading privacy and security. Optic ID is a new authentication system that analyzes a user’s iris to unlock Vision Pro, autofill passwords, and complete payments with Apple Pay. Where a user looks stays private while navigating Vision Pro, and eye tracking information is not shared with Apple, third-party apps, or websites. EyeSight also includes a visual indicator that makes it clear to others when a user is capturing a spatial photo or video.
Accessibility in visionOS
As with all Apple products, powerful accessibility features have been built right into visionOS. Key accessibility features like VoiceOver, Zoom, Switch Control, Guided Access, and more have been reimagined for spatial computing. Users can interact with Apple Vision Pro entirely with their eyes, hands, or voice, or any combination that works best for them. They can select a preferred input method such as their eyes, finger, or wrist using Pointer Control, pause on an element of visionOS for a few seconds to simulate a tap using Dwell Control, or simply use voice commands for activities across Vision Pro using Voice Control. If input from both eyes is not an option, visionOS also allows eye tracking with one dominant eye.
Apple Vision Pro and the Environment
Apple Vision Pro is designed with the environment in mind, with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating in multiple printed circuit boards. The frame and battery enclosure contain 100 percent recycled aluminum, and the Light Seal and Solo Knit Band are each made with over 70 percent recycled yarn. Vision Pro meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, PVC, and beryllium. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of eliminating plastics in all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for its global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.

PRESS RELEASE
Wanda Austin to join Apple’s board of directors
Al Gore and James Bell to retire after years of dedicated service
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced Dr. Wanda Austin, former president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, has been nominated for election to Apple’s board of directors. Dr. Austin brings decades of science and technology experience to her role, and she has a significant track record of advancing innovation and shaping corporate strategy.
As president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, Dr. Austin led an organization dedicated to supporting the U.S. space program and expanding opportunities for future exploration. She was the first woman and the first African American to hold the position.
“Wanda has spent decades advancing technology on behalf of humanity, and we’re thrilled to welcome her to Apple’s board of directors,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “She’s an extraordinary leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support our mission of leaving the world better than we found it.”
“Wanda has long been a leader in unleashing the potential of cutting-edge technology,” said Arthur Levinson, the chair of Apple’s board of directors. “She brings incredible insights and experience to our board, and she will play an important role in helping Apple continue enriching users’ lives around the world.”
“Like Apple, I’ve always believed in the power of innovation to improve lives, support human potential, and shape a better future,” said Dr. Austin. “I’m honored to join Apple’s board of directors, and I look forward to being part of a company that’s always creating new ways to empower people all over the world.”
The board has a longstanding policy that directors generally may not stand for reelection after reaching age 75. As a result, Al Gore, who has served since 2003, and James Bell, who joined in 2015, will both retire from Apple’s board this year.
“We’re deeply grateful to Al and James for their many years of service to Apple — their insights, energy, and values have made us a stronger company in so many ways,” said Cook. “For more than 20 years, Al has contributed an incredible amount to our work — from his unconditional support for protecting our users’ privacy, to his incomparable knowledge of environment and climate issues. James’s dedication has been extraordinary, and we’re thankful for the important perspectives and deep expertise he’s offered on audit, finance, and so much more over the years.”
Dr. Wanda Austin began her tenure at The Aerospace Corporation in 1979, when she joined as a member of the organization’s technical staff. Over the following decades, she took on a wide range of new roles and responsibilities, including program management and major customer-facing systems management. From 2008 to 2016, she served as the organization’s president and CEO.
From 2018 to 2019, Dr. Austin was the interim president of the University of Southern California. She serves on the board of Amgen, and also serves on the board of Chevron, where she is the lead independent director. She served on the board of Virgin Galactic, the spaceflight company, from 2019 until 2023.
Dr. Austin is also a leading advocate for STEM education. Her book,Making Space: Strategic Leadership for a Complex World, explores the leadership principles she learned during her decadeslong journey as an engineer and space industry executive.
Dr. Austin earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Franklin & Marshall College in 1975, and a master’s in civil engineering and mathematics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1977. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in industrial and systems engineering from the University of Southern California in 1988.

Users can open apps within Environments, so they can stream music, audiobooks, or podcasts as they look up at a starry night sky from Yosemite, surf the web from Haleakalā, or settle in for a movie during a storm on Mount Hood. Users can adjust the immersion of an Environment, including the volume of the ambient sounds, by rotating the Digital Crown on Apple Vision Pro.
visionOS supports several technologies unique to the Apple ecosystem to provide a seamless entertainment experience on Apple Vision Pro. With SharePlay, Vision Pro users can watch TV shows and movies, listen to music on Apple Music, and play games from the App Store and Apple Arcade with users on other Apple devices, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. visionOS also introduces several new features and technologies unique to Vision Pro: Users can enable Travel Mode to stabilize visuals for use on planes,2and Guest User to share specific apps and experiences with family and friends,3such as Photos or Safari.
The viewing experience on Apple Vision Pro is unparalleled: When a user begins watching a video, the lights around them automatically dim as the content moves closer to them. Videos can be positioned anywhere in their space or placed in an Environment for the most cinematic experience. With Environments, users can scale videos beyond the dimensions of their room, so the screen feels 100 feet wide, all while preserving the frame rate and aspect ratio. And there is no need for a remote: Users simply invoke controls with their eyes, hands, or voice.
A Personal Theater for TV Shows, Films, Sports, and More
With the Apple TV app, Apple Vision Pro users can watch all award-winning Apple Originals from Apple TV+, including Golden Globe winnerKillers of the Flower Moon, the Emmy Award-winningSTILL: A Michael J. Fox Movie, and the new, critically acclaimed limited series,Masters of the Air. Users can also access MLS Season Pass,home of Major League Soccer, and much more from popular streaming apps and channels. The Apple TV app also features the Cinema Environment, enabling viewers to transform any space into their personal theater. Users can even choose their favorite seat from the floor or balcony, and the front, middle, or back row.

Users can also watch popular online and streaming video using Safari and other browsers.
With visionOS, developers can leverage the powerful and unique capabilities of Apple Vision Pro to transform the user’s space, making the viewing experiences within their apps even more immersive.

UPDATE
Apple unveils 2024 Black Unity Collection supporting grantees that inspire resilience and creativity
REJI grantee Shout Mouse Press elevates underrepresented voices in children’s literature
In Washington, D.C.’s historic Dupont Circle neighborhood, the office of children’s literature nonprofit Shout Mouse Press is abuzz with the voices of passionate young people sitting before countless stacks of books on tall white shelves. Last year, Apple awarded Shout Mouse a grant through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative (REJI) in recognition of the nonprofit’s commitment to amplifying diverse youth voices.
With the launch of the 2024 Black Unity Collection, Apple is awarding grants to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Studio Museum in Harlem, Battersea Arts Centre, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Ghetto Film School, and the National Museum of African American Music. Apple’s support for these organizations is a continuation of REJI grants that resource organizations committed to providing economic, educational, and creative opportunities in communities of color around the world.
Founded in 2014, Shout Mouse was established to address the lack of diversity in children’s literature by engaging young people in communities underrepresented in publishing.
“The name ‘Shout Mouse’ started with the idea of how can we make visible and concrete something that was not being heard, and give it a megaphone,” says Kathy Crutcher, the nonprofit’s founder. “Apple’s support has allowed us to deepen our investment in young people — to provide technology, professional development, and most importantly, affirmation and amplification of their essential perspectives.”
On this brisk afternoon in late December, Shout Mouse has convened three alumni authors — Sasa Aakil, 20; Andy Pina, 19; and Sholachauntel Shoda, 25 — and one of its illustrators, Ian L. Springer, 25, for a brainstorm on character development. The topic of discussion: Who is missing from today’s youth literary canon of Black history?
“A lot of times we see Black History Month just from one lens, or from three or four different historical figures,” Springer says to the group.
“Even the stories of Black women in Black history specifically — they were so pivotal but so often not talked about, besides Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks,” adds Aakil, a poet and the coauthor of Shout Mouse’s award-winningI Am the Night Sky, who writes about the intersectionality of living as a Black Muslim American woman.
Through its writing workshops, the books it publishes, and speaking opportunities held in partnership with youth-centered organizations in the D.C. area, Shout Mouse is harnessing the creativity and resilience of young people, and equipping them with the skills needed to navigate the publishing industry and beyond.
“Oftentimes young people are told that they’re not the experts of their own experience, or that they aren’t yet equipped to comment on or impact the world around them,” explains Alexa Patrick, Shout Mouse’s programs director, who is leading the afternoon’s brainstorm. “So what we seek to do is invite young people into a space where they’re able to be the experts of their own experience and to share their stories.”
Sasa Aakil, who was awarded Youth Poet Laureate of Montgomery County in Maryland and is a current college student at Howard University, participated in Shout Mouse’s writing workshop with Muslim American youth. For 10 days, she and nine peers gathered to brainstorm, write, and create content about their lived experiences.
“Me and my fellow artists really felt like we had to make a statement of who we are,” Aakil says. “I really wanted to highlight that being Black American and Muslim was okay, and not only okay, but that it was a thing, because a lot of people like to erase my people. So the mission statement that we came up with was really just taking up space.”
I Am the Night Sky, the anthologythat resulted from the workshop, is just one example of Shout Mouse’s ambitious intention to amplify stories by and for members of the communities the nonprofit reaches.
Since its launch, Shout Mouse has published 59 books, all produced in collaboration with young people and local community-based partners. There are currently more than 125,000 Shout Mouse books in circulation, which can be found in D.C.-area schools and nonprofits, as well as in schools, libraries, bookstores, and homes in every state in the country. The nonprofit also helps put the books in the hands of immigrant children separated from their families.
Many of Shout Mouse’s books were conceived, written, and illustrated by youth in response to the cultural moments of their time. Thanks in part to the work of Shout Mouse, these moments have been captured in literature that all children can read and enjoy as part of modern American history.
“When we don’t have diverse stories and diverse voices, we miss things,” Aakil says. “There are so many experiences that we’ve just never gotten to experience because we are stuck to our own bodies. So it’s so important to have stories, because that’s one of the easiest ways to empathize with each other. And when we can empathize, we can make space for one another.”
Apple Celebrates Black Resilience with New Black Unity Collection
The new Black Unity Collection introduces new expressions inspired by the resilience and beauty of the Black community. Blooming flowers and vibrant colors represent Pan-Africanism and symbolize generations working together to address injustice and dismantle systemic barriers.
The Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Band features an arrangement of flowers molded abstractly across the band utilizing red, green, and yellow colors. Inspired by the rich cultural diversity of Black communities around the world, Apple used a unique layering process for the flowers to create tiny variations in each band’s design, ensuring no two bands are exactly alike. The pin of the band is coated with a durable diamond-like carbon finish that features an etching of the words “Truth, Power, Solidarity” alongside one of four symbolic flower emblems.
The Unity Bloom Apple Watch face showcases a beautiful floral design that signifies a lasting commitment to the pursuit of a more equitable world. Users can choose between a full-bloom or single-bloom arrangement, and when they raise their wrist, the flowers begin to bloom and fill with vibrant hues. iPhone and iPad users can also show their support with the new Unity Bloom wallpaper for their Lock Screen, which presents an outline of flowers that fill with color when the display is active.

2024-01-25,Decrease,"Apple announces changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store in the European Union","Text of this article
January 25, 2024
PRESS RELEASE
Apple announces changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store in the European Union
For developers, the changes include new options for app distribution and payment processingFor users, the changes include new controls and disclosures, and expanded protections to reduce privacy and security risks the DMA creates
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced changes to iOS, Safari, and the App Store impacting developers’ apps in the European Union (EU) to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The changes include more than 600 new APIs, expanded app analytics, functionality for alternative browser engines, and options for processing app payments and distributing iOS apps. Across every change, Apple is introducing new safeguards that reduce — but don’t eliminate — new risks the DMA poses to EU users. With these steps, Apple will continue to deliver the best, most secure experience possible for EU users.
The new options for processing payments and downloading apps on iOS open new avenues for malware, fraud and scams, illicit and harmful content, and other privacy and security threats. That’s why Apple is introducing protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, an authorization for marketplace developers, and disclosures on alternative payments — to reduce risks and deliver the best, most secure experience possible for users in the EU. Even with these safeguards in place, many risks remain.
Developers can learn about these changes on theApple Developer Support pageand can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.
“The changes we’re announcing today comply with the Digital Markets Act’s requirements in the European Union, while helping to protect EU users from the unavoidable increased privacy and security threats this regulation brings. Our priority remains creating the best, most secure possible experience for our users in the EU and around the world,” said Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow. “Developers can now learn about the new tools and terms available for alternative app distribution and alternative payment processing, new capabilities for alternative browser engines and contactless payments, and more. Importantly, developers can choose to remain on the same business terms in place today if they prefer.”
The changes for EU apps reflect the European Commission’s designation of iOS, Safari, and the App Store as “core platform services” under the Digital Markets Act. In March, Apple will share new resources to help EU users understand the changes they can expect. That includes guidance to help EU users navigate complexities the DMA’s changes bring — including a less intuitive user experience — and best practices for approaching new risks associated with downloading apps and processing payments outside of the App Store.
Available for developers’ apps around the world, Apple also announcednew options for streaming games, along with more than 50 forthcoming reports in areas like engagement, commerce, app usage, and more.
Changes to iOS
In the EU, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the DMA. For developers, those changes include new options for distributing apps. The coming changes to iOS in the EU include:
As announced by the European Commission, Apple is also sharing DMA-compliant changes impacting contactless payments. That includes new APIs enabling developers to use NFC technology in their banking and wallet apps throughout the European Economic Area. And in the EU, Apple is introducing new controls that allow users to select a third-party contactless payment app — or an alternative app marketplace — as their default.
Inevitably, the new options for developers’ EU apps create new risks to Apple users and their devices. Apple can’t eliminate those risks, but within the DMA’s constraints, the company will take steps to reduce them. These safeguards will be in place when users download iOS 17.4 or later, beginning in March, and include:
These protections — including Notarization for iOS apps, and authorization for marketplace developers — help reduce some of the privacy and security risks to iOS users in the EU. That includes threats like malware or malicious code, and risks of installing apps that misrepresent their functionality or the responsible developer.
However, Apple has less ability to address other risks — including apps that contain scams, fraud, and abuse, or that expose users to illicit, objectionable, or harmful content. In addition, apps that use alternative browser engines — other than Apple’s WebKit — may negatively affect the user experience, including impacts to system performance and battery life.
Within the DMA’s constraints, Apple is committed to protecting the privacy, security, and quality of the iOS user experience in the EU as much as possible. For instance, App Tracking Transparency will continue to work with apps distributed outside of the App Store — asking a user’s permission before a developer tracks their data across apps or websites. However, the DMA’s requirements mean that App Store features — including Family Purchase Sharing and Ask to Buy — will not be compatible with apps downloaded from outside of the App Store.
When these changes come into effect in March, Apple will share more detailed resources explaining the options available to users — including best practices for protecting their privacy and security.
Changes to Safari
Today, iOS users already have the ability to set a third-party web browser — other than Safari — as their default. Reflecting the DMA’s requirements, Apple is also introducing a new choice screen that will surface when users first open Safari in iOS 17.4 or later. That screen will prompt EU users to choose a default browser from a list of options.
This change is a result of the DMA’s requirements, and means that EU users will be confronted with a list of default browsers before they have the opportunity to understand the options available to them. The screen also interrupts EU users’ experience the first time they open Safari intending to navigate to a webpage.
Changes to the App Store
On the App Store, Apple is sharing a number of changes for developers with apps in the EU, affecting apps across Apple’s operating systems — including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The changes also include new disclosures informing EU users of the risks associated with using alternatives to the App Store’s secure payment processing.
The changes also include new steps to protect and inform EU users, including:
For apps that use alternative payment processing, Apple will not be able to issue refunds, and will have less ability to support customers encountering issues, scams, or fraud. Helpful App Store features — like Report a Problem, Family Sharing, and Ask to Buy — will also not reflect these transactions. Users may have to share their payment information with additional parties, creating more opportunities for bad actors to steal sensitive financial information. And on the App Store, users’ purchase history and subscription management will only reflect transactions made using the App Store’s In-App Purchase system.
New Business Terms for Apps in the EU
Also today, Apple is sharing new business terms available for developers’ apps in the European Union. Developers can choose to adopt these new business terms, or stay on Apple’s existing terms. Developers must adopt the new business terms for EU apps to use the new capabilities for alternative distribution or alternative payment processing.
The new business terms for apps in the EU are necessary to support the DMA’s requirements for alternative distribution and payment processing. That includes a fee structure that reflects the many ways Apple creates value for developers’ businesses — including distribution and discovery on the App Store, the App Store’s secure payment processing, Apple’s trusted and secure mobile platform, and all the tools and technology to build and share innovative apps with users around the world.
Developers operating under either set of business terms can continue to use the App Store’s secure payment processing and share their apps on the App Store in the EU. And both sets of business terms reflect Apple’s long-standing work to make the app ecosystem the best opportunity for all developers.
Developers operating under the new business terms will have the option to distribute their iOS apps from the App Store and/or alternative app marketplaces. These developers can also choose to use alternative payment processors in their EU apps on the App Store, across Apple’s operating systems.
The new business terms for iOS apps in the EU have three elements:
For apps on iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS in the EU, developers who process payments using a PSP or by linking out to their website will get a 3 percent discount on the commission they owe to Apple.
Apple is also sharing afee calculator tooland new reports to help developers estimate the potential impact of the new business terms on their app businesses. Developers can learn more about the changes for EU apps on a newApple Developer Support pageand can begin testing these capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta.

February 29, 2024
UPDATE
Apple expands Self Service Repair for Mac, adds Diagnostics, and updates System Configuration
Apple today announced an expansion of Self Service Repair for MacBook Pro and iMac models powered by M3, with support available today. Since April 2022, Self Service Repair has given customers access to the same manuals, genuine Apple parts, and tools used at Apple Store locations and Apple Authorized Service Providers.
Apple is also making Apple Diagnostics for Self Service Repair available for MacBook Pro and iMac models powered by M3 in the U.S. early next month. Launched late last year for iPhone and Mac, Apple Diagnostics troubleshooting sessions give customers the same ability as Apple Authorized Service Providers and Independent Repair Providers to test devices for optimal part functionality and performance, as well as identify which parts may need repair.
In addition, Apple is updating the System Configuration process for all Mac models to streamline the repair process and make it more efficient. Mac users will no longer need to contact the Self Service Repair support team to run the final step of a repair, but the team will still be available to assist as needed. The updated process will become available early next month in all countries where Self Service Repair is supported.
Self Service Repair is part of Apple’s efforts to expand access to repairs. Widespread repair access plays an important role in extending products’ longevity, which is good for users and good for the planet. For the vast majority of users who do not have experience repairing electronic devices, visiting a professional authorized repair provider with certified technicians who use genuine Apple parts is the safest and most reliable way to get a repair.
In the last five years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training, including more than 5,000 Independent Repair Providers and a global network of approximately 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers.

March 5, 2024
UPDATE
Apple introduces transcripts for Apple Podcasts
Transcripts offer full-text display for each episode, making podcasts more accessible and immersive than ever before
Today Apple introduces transcripts for Apple Podcasts, an innovative new feature that makes podcasts more accessible and easier to navigate.
With transcripts, users can read the full text of an episode, search the episode for a specific word or phrase, and tap on the text to play the podcast from that point in the episode. As an episode plays, each word is highlighted, making it easy to follow along.
“Introducing transcripts on Apple Podcasts builds on Apple’s commitment to making products and services for everyone,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director, Global Accessibility Policy & Initiatives. “We are thrilled to make transcripts widely available for all, adding an additional layer of accessibility to the Podcasts experience.”
Transcripts can enhance a user’s podcast experience in multiple ways, helping them catch every word from their favorite hosts, learn a new language, and more easily find facts they heard on an episode. Users will be able to access an episode’s transcript from the bottom-left corner on the Now Playing screen.
Transcripts were built to strengthen accessibility. The font and color contrast were designed to make long-form text easier to scan and read. Users who are Deaf or hard of hearing are also able to access transcripts without having to press play on the episode.
Starting today, transcripts are available for English-, French-, Spanish-, and German-language podcasts on iPhone and iPad with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4. Transcripts will not offer translations from one language to another. Transcripts will automatically be available for new episodes shortly after episodes are published. Previously released episodes will be transcribed over time.
Creators who prefer to provide their own transcripts can do so through RSS tags or in Apple Podcasts Connect for subscriber episodes. Learn more atpodcasters.apple.com/support/5316-transcripts-on-apple-podcasts.
Availability
Transcripts are available with iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 for podcasts in English, French, German, and Spanish, with back-catalog episodes being added over time. Transcripts can be accessed in over 170 countries and regions.

March 6, 2024
UPDATE
Three app creators shaping the future of education, fitness, and health
The creators behind Boddle, Run Legends, and Wysa — all alumni of Apple’s Entrepreneur Camp — share how they’re empowering people with their cutting-edge apps
Around the world, developers are building apps that break down barriers across gender, race, socioeconomic status, language, and physical ability.
In celebration of Entrepreneur Camp’s fifth anniversary, Apple spoke with alumni app creators whose apps are shaking things up in education, fitness, and mental health. All three women have participated in the immersive tech lab that invites developers from underrepresented groups to take their apps to the next level with one-on-one guidance from Apple experts, engineers, and leaders. Entrepreneur Camp underscores Apple’s ethos that apps for everyone should be made by everyone.
Edna Martinson, a 2023 Entrepreneur Camp alum based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, launchedBoddle Learningduring the COVID-19 pandemic, when students and teachers were adjusting to the sudden transition to learning from home. The education app for kids uses gameplay and machine learning to tailor content to their learning levels, helping them tackle learning gaps and boost their confidence in the classroom.
After graduating from MIT, 2022 Entrepreneur Camp alum Jenny Xu founded her own studio and fused two of her lifelong passions — running and gaming — intoRun Legends. The immersive multiplayer game was designed to make walking and running more fun, encouraging players of all fitness levels to team up with friends to battle and overcome real-life anxieties.
And Jo Aggarwal, a 2019 Entrepreneur Camp alum, is the founder and CEO ofWysa, an emotionally intelligent chatbot — written by therapists working with AI designers — to help users talk through difficult emotions and thoughts anonymously, anytime. Based in Boston and Bengaluru, the app has helped millions of people across 95 countries learn how to feel happier.
Below, Martinson, Xu, and Aggarwal reflect on their journeys to becoming app developers, how they’ve infused personalization into their apps to make them more accessible to all, key lessons they’ve learned along the way and at Entrepreneur Camp, and how they’ve harnessed technology to craft innovative solutions to real-world problems.
Making Space for Women in App Development
Jenny Xu (JX): When I started out in the gaming industry, I felt like I was the only one doing what I was doing. I grew up playing a lot of story-based interactive fiction — artistic games that make you come away having learned something about life, and I think that’s a genre that’s predominantly popular with women. With Run Legends, even though it’s a battle game, it isn’t a game that makes people feel really aggressive when they’re playing it — they can feel empowered. Now that I’ve raised some money and shipped some games, I try to give back and show that it’s possible to build games that aren’t just shooters, but games that actually make the world a better place.
Edna Martinson (EM): My perspective as a woman in this field has really shaped our team and how we connect with our community, especially since most elementary school teachers that we serve are women. We’ve had a blast doing virtual career days on Zoom, showing kids how we made Boddle, and introducing them to game design. It’s super rewarding to see the excitement on little girls’ faces when they find out a woman cofounded Boddle. It shows them they can be leaders in tech too.
Breaking Down Barriers Through Personalization
Jo Aggarwal (JA): We set out to solve for global mental health and give people a safe space to work through their thoughts and emotions, building resilience irrespective of stigma, race, gender, access to a therapist, or diagnosis… Language can also be a barrier, and in an effort to make Wysa’s support more inclusive, we are launching Wysa in Spanish to create more equitable access to marginalized communities.
EM: At Boddle, we understand that every kid learns differently and at their own pace, so we’re using machine learning to tailor content to kids’ levels and help identify learning gaps through fun and interactive gameplay. We also provide teachers with the tools to be able to support their students, giving them access to kindergarten through sixth-grade assessments and videos in math and English, and a host of grading and reporting tools.
JX: We noticed that in other fitness experiences, people who were faster or more fit were often rewarded for how fit they were, so others would be intimidated. Run Legends uses core location, core motion, and accelerometer data on the Apple platform to detect how fast somebody is going and adjust the gameplay based on that. So if you want to play at a 20-minute walking pace or at an eight-minute running pace, it’s all the same. There’s actually no advantage to going faster or slower through our game. There are quite a few walkers who play the game and say that the game’s gotten them to go from walking to eventually going faster and moving up to a jog.
Finding Support and Mentorship
JA: Entrepreneur Camp was amazing, meeting so many like-minded entrepreneurs and making friends with them. I do stay in touch with some of the cohort who are in similar fields. The campus is so beautifully designed, and to learn Apple design principles within that environment was like a dream come true. We had design sessions with Apple team members who helped us understand how to position Wysa, and today, we are one of the top-ranked apps in our space.
JX: When we attended Entrepreneur Camp, it was very early on in Run Legends. We didn’t even know necessarily what the game would look like. We got this opportunity to talk to the design team, who knew what was working on the App Store and would do deep dives on our app. One example was our onboarding experience — our rep told us, “What happens if a player isn’t ready to run or go outside? You would lose so many people if you didn’t provide an alternate experience that could be played indoors.” So we changed our entire onboarding flow because of that feedback and realized after launch that almost half of all players used the alternate experience.
Building More Immersive Experiences
EM: Boddle is more than just a game for math or English. We’re creating a learning metaverse with different game experiences. If kids love basketball, they can jump into a basketball game. If they’re into pets, they can check out our pet-battling game. The cool part is they get to pick what they want to play, and their learning goes with them wherever they go in Boddle’s world. They’re in charge of their own learning adventure, picking what they want to do and learning along the way.
JX:In Run Legends, we use Spatial Audio so that when you turn your head, it sounds like the battle is actually happening around you. If you turn to the left, you might hear the monster snarling at you, but if you turn right, you could hear your teammates cheering you on. You feel the haptics as you charge up your attack and as you sprint, and you feel like the battle is happening right there. That feeling gets people to work out longer and harder. Players often tell us they’ve done the fastest walks or runs in their entire life through it, and it’s because of that interactive audio experience.
JA: What has truly been unique about Wysa has been how we iterated the product. We did not start with a clinical workbook and turn it into a chatbot. We took evidence-based techniques that worked, and then listened to users about what they needed and where some didn’t work for them. We then worked with clinicians to create models that worked for users when they tried to help themselves. This created a power balance between users and clinicians, powered by AI and analytics, which had never been possible before.
Creating Innovative Solutions to Real-World Problems
JA: We wanted to make access to mental health permissionless — something you could reach out to on your phone at 3 a.m. and continue to use as often as you needed. Research shows that people are 3x more likely to open up to AI than even a human therapist. This creates an opportunity to create psychological safety, but also must be followed through with privacy-first design and proven, measurable outcomes. We were able to show impact with adolescents as well as older adults with chronic pain, with blue collar workers as well as tech professionals.
JX: The narrative in Run Legends is that you’re fighting real-world anxieties through your battles in the game. So you’re not fighting a minion or a generic enemy: You’re fighting your critical grandma who’s telling you you’re not good enough, or a hyper-competitive Chad who’s always trying to beat you. We’ve heard our players say it’s a cathartic experience. They’re actually healing from the battles and the narrative of overcoming obstacles.

March 11, 2024
UPDATE
Apple Vision Pro unlocks new opportunities for health app developers
Breakthrough health and wellness apps are designed to take advantage of the infinite canvas in visionOS, unveiling spatial experiences that benefit users in clinical settings and at home
For decades, medical institutions and developers have taken advantage of Apple’s innovative products and frameworks to help achieve better patient outcomes, increase cost savings, broaden research opportunities, and improve efficiency. From using iPad to lower the cost and shorten the length of NICU stays so newborns can be at home with their families, to iPhone helping nurses respond faster to alerts and alarms and improve medication administration, the healthcare community has driven purposeful change with powerful Apple products at their fingertips.
Now, with the introduction of Apple Vision Pro, developers have unparalleled opportunities to deliver experiences that can positively impact people’s lives, whether they’re at home or at a clinic. Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, unlocking powerful spatial experiences in an infinite canvas. And with the unique capabilities of visionOS, healthcare developers are creating new apps that were not previously possible, transforming areas such as clinical education, surgical planning, training, medical imaging, behavioral health, and more.
“We’re thrilled to see the incredible apps that developers across the healthcare community are bringing to Apple Vision Pro,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “The imagination and drive of our developers, combined with the technical capabilities of visionOS, are igniting new possibilities for physicians, frontline workers, and even students, and we can’t wait to see what’s to come.”
Here are just a few of the apps currently available on Apple Vision Pro in the healthcare and wellness space.
Surgical Planning and Education
More than 1 million Americans receive a knee or hip replacement surgery every year, and that number will continue to rise as the population ages.1When surgeons use Stryker’s Mako SmartRobotics for total hip, total knee, and partial knee replacements, it can help lead to better patient outcomes like less pain and shorter recovery times, compared to traditional joint replacement surgeries. With the newmyMakoapp, Stryker is extending a surgeon’s experience in and beyond the operating room with Apple Vision Pro and iPhone. For better preparation, myMako allows surgeons to visualize and review patients’ Mako surgical plans at any time in a brilliant, immersive visual experience.
“The myMako app for Apple Vision Pro allows surgeons the ability to access intricate surgical plan details and insights at their fingertips in a 3D-native, intuitive, and dynamic way. This level of insight — anytime, anywhere — was previously not possible,” said Robert Cohen, Stryker’s president of Digital, Robotics, and Enabling Technologies. “With Apple Vision Pro, Stryker’s market-leading enabling technologies such as Mako SmartRobotics have the exciting potential to transform the way surgeons think about preoperative planning and the intraoperative experience, all consistent with Stryker’s mission to make healthcare better.”
To alleviate some of the timely challenges healthcare workers face in onboarding and training, Boston Children’s Hospital developed a comprehensive learning experience in a safe, universally accessible virtual environment.

UPDATE
Apple expands innovative Restore Fund with TSMC and Murata
Suppliers will support new nature-based carbon removal projects alongside Apple, as the fund’s initial phase is underway
Today Apple welcomed key manufacturing partners Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Murata Manufacturing as new investors in the Restore Fund, which is designed to scale global investment in high-quality, nature-based carbon removal while protecting critical ecosystems. Global semiconductor foundry TSMC will invest up to $50 million in a fund managed by Climate Asset Management, a joint venture of HSBC Asset Management and Pollination. Murata — an iPhone supplier based in Japan — will invest up to $30 million in the same fund. These new investments build on Apple’s previous commitment of up to $200 million for the Restore Fund’s second phase, bringing the total to $280 million in committed capital.
Apple also announced the partners in the Restore Fund’s initial phase,launched in 2021. Through these investments, Apple, Goldman Sachs, and Conservation International are partnering with experienced forestry managers — Symbiosis, BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, and Arbaro Advisors — to supportthe creation of sustainably certified working forestson degraded pasture and agricultural lands in South America. Apple expects the portfolio to exceed its goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air by 2025.
“When businesses invest in nature, they’re also investing in healthier communities, a more resilient global economy, and a critical tool in the fight against climate change,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “The Restore Fund is already delivering real benefits for communities and ecosystems in South America while removing carbon from the atmosphere. And we’re thrilled to see suppliers join us by investing in nature on top of their urgent work to decarbonize their businesses.”
High-Quality Investments in NatureTo select the portfolio of projects in its first phase, the Restore Fund carefully assessed prospective managers and investments to ensure they meet robust environmental, social, and governance criteria, and strict standards for quality, scalability, and impact. Most potential investments are screened out through this intensive due diligence process, which is further detailed in a recent white paper on Apple’s carbon removal strategy.
All projects selected for the Restore Fund undergo regular assessments to monitor forest change and growth over time, address fire and other potential risks, and verify forest carbon stock. As part of this analysis, Apple and partners — including Space Intelligence and Upstream Tech — have used innovative tools such as LiDAR on iPhone, satellite data, bioacoustic monitoring, and machine learning to evaluate the wellbeing of the land and project progress.
The projects in the Restore Fund’s first phase all share a goal of creating new, responsibly managed working forests to help meet increasing global demand for timber and reduce pressure on natural forests. The projects will be managed by:
These managers will ensure all projects meet the Restore Fund’s rigorous standards.
Progress to Carbon NeutralityTSMC and Murata are among themore than 300 suppliersin Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, having committed to achieving 100 percent renewable electricity for all Apple production by 2030. In 2022, Apple called on its suppliers to go even further and decarbonize all of their Apple-related operations by the end of this decade. This includes addressing unavoidable residual emissions with high-quality carbon removal.
The fund TSMC and Murata are investing in alongside Apple will pool regenerative agriculture projects with ecosystem conservation and restoration projects in order to generate both carbon and financial benefits. Project selection is currently underway.
The Restore Fund is an important component of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire value chain by the end of this decade. Apple is laser-focused on driving down its carbon footprint by 75 percent from 2015 levels through direct emissions reductions and will address residual emissions with high-quality carbon removal. The company only retires credits from carbon projects where verified removal has already occurred, and only uses credits to address residual emissions that are difficult to avoid or abate with today’s available solutions.

2024-03-13,Decrease,Apple’s Restore Fund cultivates new roots in the Atlantic Forest,"It was inspiring to me to see the power of restoration of nature and how traditional knowledge can be combined with science.
Bruno Mariani, founder and CEO at Symbiosis
Text of this article
March 13, 2024
UPDATE
Apple’s Restore Fund cultivates new roots in the Atlantic Forest
Restore Fund projects in South America are reforesting the land, one seedling at a time
In South America’s Atlantic Forest, many suggest that life depends on a mother: the superior matriarch who provides for all. This is true for its plants and animals, and even the trees that tower above, reaching skyward to the sun while providing shade for the life that resides in their underbrush.
It is estimated there are 5,000 tree species in existence in the Atlantic Forest today. Of those species, two-thirds are threatened with extinction after centuries of exploitative, extractive practices. Restoring the rainforest — a potential 100 million-acre restoration area in Brazil alone — has been at the core of Apple-supported projects in the region, including one just inland from the coastal town of Trancoso in Bahia, Brazil, where one company is cultivating seedlings frommother trees, the most resilient trees from multiple species that have survived the rainforest’s destruction.
“We started with the best genetic material possible, harvested in a huge native reserve of the Atlantic rainforest,” explains Bruno Mariani, forest management and investment company Symbiosis’s founder and CEO. “That would attract a lot of fauna and insects.”
Founded in 2008, Symbiosis has been collecting, banking, and planting seeds from mother trees of various Brazilian native species since 2010. “The mother tree represents the nature that provides us all the energy and the basis for restoration, so the mother tree gives us all,” says Mickael Mello, Symbiosis’s plant nursery manager.
Symbiosis is one of three investments that are part of Apple’sRestore Fund, announced in 2021 with the goal of scaling nature-based solutions to address climate change. In partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, the Restore Fund has invested in three carbon removal projects across Brazil and Paraguay with the aim of delivering benefits that go far beyond carbon — from strengthening local livelihoods to enhancing biodiversity.
Since their first planting, which consisted of 160 different species spread across an area that will be permanently protected from wood harvesting, Symbiosis has expanded its restoration of threatened native trees. In its efforts to decrease biodiversity loss, Symbiosis has committed to conserving 40 percent of its land with natural, multispecies forests, while the remaining land supplies precious tropical hardwoods from responsibly managed sources. After planting 800 hectares of biodiverse forestland over a decade, the company has ambitions to plant over 1 million seedlings on 1,000 hectares in 2024 alone.
“Trees work in groups, like a network,” says Mariani. “They are social beings and they want to help each other. For different species, their roots go to different depths of the soil so they’re not competing — they’re cooperating.”
The Atlantic Forest is situated along South America’s eastern coast, starting in northeastern Brazil and sprawling farther inland as it makes its way down to southeastern Paraguay and northern Argentina. It is just 40 miles wide at its northernmost point and stretches approximately 200 miles inland from its southern Atlantic coastline. After more than 500 years of deforestation, the rainforest has been depleted by 80 percent, with the terrain cultivated as agricultural land for coffee, cacao, sugarcane, and other crops; and used as pastures for livestock. Much of the rainforest has been depleted of its precious hardwoods — including the brazilwood and Brazilian rosewood used in furniture, construction, and even musical instruments like guitars. Today, similar activity is underway in the Amazon.
Estimates show the Atlantic Forest has a potential reforestation area of around 40 million hectares, or 100 million acres. Symbiosis’s approach to forestry aims to both create a high-quality sustainable working forest while continuing the fight against climate change with one of the most vital tools for carbon sequestration: nature itself. “We’re balancing wood production and carbon stocks,” explains Alan Batista, Symbiosis’s chief financial officer who studied forestry and whose career spans plant propagation in the pulp and paper industry, business strategy, economics, and finance.
“Woody biomass actually creates a lot of carbon stored here, and we know we have a lot of carbon being stored in the soil as well,” Batista says. “So when it comes to harvesting, we have to think all the way from the beginning to the end of the cycle. The management we’re applying here is continuous cover forest management, meaning we’re going to manage for perpetuity. It’s going to always be covered with forest.”
To calculate the carbon stored on its land, Symbiosis has integrated Space Intelligence’s satellite data, ecological knowledge, and machine learning to create land cover, land cover change, and forest carbon maps. Satellite data is integrated with readings from the ForestScanner app, which takes field measurements with the LiDAR scanner on iPhone to determine age and growth rate. “They’re helping us to screen properties and land use — how much pasture area, forest areas, and retroactive deforestation,” Batista explains.
Part of the screening process is identifying areas that are designated as land that belongs to Indigenous communities, who Symbiosis hopes to soon partner with on identifying and collecting seeds from mother trees on their lands. After visiting the Amazon in 2007 to see how one Indigenous community reforested an area that had been destroyed by loggers along the Peruvian border, Mariani was inspired.
“The leaders were talking to me about climate change and they took me to that place they reforested, and it looked like an original forest,” Mariani recalls. “It was inspiring to me to see the power of restoration of nature and how traditional knowledge can be combined with science.”
A little over 1,600 miles southwest of Trancoso, another Restore Fund project is underway at Forestal Apepu in the San Pedro district of Paraguay.
In this southwestern region of the Atlantic Forest, Forestal Apepu is developing fast-growing eucalyptus forests for high-quality timber production on lands that were deforested decades ago, while protecting the remaining natural forest and planting native species through experimental trials. By focusing on high-quality timber managed on longer growing cycles, Forestal Apepu allows for more carbon removal and longer-term storage on its forestland. They also hope the solid wood products produced from their high-quality timber will alleviate pressures on the natural forest itself, resulting in carbon being stored in long-lived wood products even after a tree is cut.
A key part of Forestal Apepu’s work extends beyond the borders of the forest: The project is also supporting the local communities through a series of social impact initiatives around the neighboring San Estanislao, Paraguay.
The landlocked region has depended on the forest for timber, firewood, and their agricultural needs for generations. As part of Apple’s Restore Fund, Forestal Apepu is working with local communities to identify alternate sources of supplemental income that alleviate pressure on the timber forests in the area. These sources include employment in the company’s Forest Stewardship Council-certified eucalyptus farms, land leases through its outgrower model (in which smallholder landowners are given seedlings and technical assistance to grow and manage timber), chicken production through a local women’s association, and yerba mate cultivation.
Graciela Gimenez has lived in Cururu’o, a small community of roughly 1,200 people, for 40 years. Every morning, she wakes at 5 a.m. to start her daily routine: feeding and changing the water for her chickens, cleaning the house, cooking the family’s meals, and tending to any needs that may arise for the women’s association she helped create and is president of.
“I’ve always been very present in the community,” Gimenez says. “They like that I have the power to get things going.”
After multiple meetings with Forestal Apepu’s social liaison officer, Gladys Nuñez, Gimenez and the women of the community came together to develop an income stream from raising chickens. Previously, households had inconsistent income primarily from day laboring on nearby land. After Forestal Apepu added 21 chickens to her coop in 2023, Gimenez now has 51 chickens that produce eggs and meat for the family to eat and also to sell.
“We have to take care of our neighbors, who should also be our allies,” Nuñez says. “All of those people from the communities that are working at Apepu, including myself, we are learning every day about forest management, like the health and safety about pesticides or the better use of natural resources. This learning as a community is going to help the environment.”
Ramon Mariotti, leader of the Palomita I community who settled in the area in 1962 after drought and devastation in the Chaco region, has been growing yerba mate, an herbal tea that for many Paraguayans is the only substance to quench their thirst, in the area. Mariotti’s father taught him the ins and outs of cultivation, including knowing when the leaves are ready, how delicately they must be picked by hand, how to dry and grind them, and how to determine what’s best to sell.
“Ever since we got here, we realized how rich this land is,” Mariotti says. “It’s like having a nature supermarket surrounding us: We can plant anything.”
To help expand their harvest, Mariotti has been working with Forestal Apepu’s Alberto Florentín to improve their planting process, including knowing when to plant and how close together they should be to one another.
Florentín has spent 40 years as a forest engineer traveling throughout Paraguay, first with the forest service, then with the National Parks Center at the Museo Moisés Bertoni, a nature preserve where he helped recruit park rangers from the Indigenous communities he was meeting in the area. Florentín credits the knowledge he gained from his many visits to Paraguay’s various regions with his ability to survive anywhere in the country and help others thrive purely on the land itself.
“I want to make sure people here can watch things grow and we do not leave a desert for the future generations,” Florentín says. “With climate change, things have become more and more difficult — water sources are getting scarce, and things that grow are more difficult to find. So I want to make sure that they have all the resources in order to keep growing.”
Beyond its community projects, Forestal Apepu is also looking for ways to monitor the wellbeing of the land in its forested areas.
A bioacoustic monitoring experiment has been recording the sounds of the forest, helping a partner team of biologists detect the levels of biodiversity throughout the forest using artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Across Forestal Apepu’s project sites in Paraguay and Symbiosis’s in Brazil, efforts to record, preserve, and revitalize the flora and fauna in each region may seem disconnected, but dig below the surface and they share mutual goals: ensuring the resilience of the most natural places on earth that have for too long been taken for granted.
As Symbiosis’s Mariani recognized when he first started thinking about his company and ultimately solidified its name, “It’s the cooperation among different species with mutual benefits — the opposite of a parasite. What I want to do is symbiosis. It’s a win-win for everybody.”

Pushing the limit with Apple Watch Ultra and The Speed Project
Members of L.A.’s Koreatown Run Club and New York’s Old Man Run Club join forces to take on the 300-plus-mile relay from Santa Monica to Las Vegas
Driving along Ocean Avenue around 3:30 a.m. on a cool Friday morning in March, most of Santa Monica is perfectly quiet and still. But as the car approaches Colorado Avenue, a low din of voices begins to build. Every block, it grows louder and louder, until suddenly its source becomes clear, illuminated beneath the blazing neon at the entrance to the city’s iconic pier.
Hundreds of people have gathered here for the start of The Speed Project, an annual relay event that attracts brave souls from all over the world. The energy is electric: Team RVs covered with DIY signage line the street, massive flags ripple in the wind, and a drone flies overhead, casting an otherworldly glow on the undulating crowd. As the clock strikes 4 a.m., the teams scatter off in every direction.
Members of Los Angeles’s Koreatown Run Club (KRC) and New York City’s Old Man Run Club (OMRC) have been training for this day for months, joining forces from their respective coasts to take on the grueling 300-plus-mile route through the Mojave Desert to Las Vegas. There are no rules, no support stations, no spectators, no rain delays — just the runners, their navigators, their crew, and the open road. And that’s a big part of the appeal.
Through it all — the rugged landscape, the sleep deprivation, the dehydration, the extreme temperatures, and the pouring rain — Apple Watch Ultra 2 was an essential companion, offering the 12-member team the ability to instantly keep tabs on each others’ locations, take hands-free calls, keep an eye on their pace, provide visibility in the darkness, and view their elevation.
“Apple Watch Ultra 2 was our instant lifeline to each other,” says Cindy Le, the team’s veteran navigator and crew captain — a sentiment echoed by cocaptain Ja Tecson.
“The watch is truly made for the conditions we were going through, especially when we did our trail runs at night,” Tecson adds.
Made from aerospace-grade titanium, Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple’s most capable and rugged watch, with the best battery life of any Apple Watch, advanced running metrics, easy-to-read Workout Views, a range of training experiences, and Apple’s brightest display.
The team’s photographers — A.J. Lising, Jeremy Jude Lee, and Ja Tecson — documented their journey in a series of images shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max, and edited in Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with an analog aesthetic, capturing the emotion of each moment.

Early Friday morning, the team’s 12 runners and eight support crew members are already running on adrenaline and very little sleep. Everyone is excited to watch teammate Annie Cun — who is here at the starting line despite a recent cancer diagnosis — kick off the very first segment. “This is a journey that we’re doing together,” says Le, reminding the runners in the huddle to stay in the moment and not just focus on their final destination. “Like in life, there’s not really a finish line. There’s only this present moment over and over and over again.”

At night, Tecson says Apple Watch Ultra 2 provided the team with an extra sense of safety: “I would always turn my flashlight setting on, because there were a lot of really aggressive drivers on the road.”
Saturday, 12:36:15 a.m.Newberry Springs, Mojave Desert
Sleep deprivation is an inescapable part of The Speed Project experience. “A lot of people, when you get into ‘I’m hungry, I’m tired, I’m cranky,’ you can really lose who you are a little bit,” says team cocaptain Will Eckman. “You have that shared experience with everyone else, and how do you all push each other up to get through? I think everybody was certainly feeling it in the overnight moments between midnight and 7 a.m.”
Saturday, 09:10:12 a.m.Death Valley Road, Baker
Though many of the runners from the two clubs hadn’t met in person until the night before the race, it doesn’t take long for a sense of camaraderie to build on the road. “It just felt so natural, everybody coming together and really building a friendship,” says Will Eckman. “It almost felt like we had been friends for a very long time. That was amazing to see very quickly.”
Saturday, 09:25:48 a.m.Baker, Mojave Desert
Out on the road, the runners use Apple Watch Ultra 2 to stay in touch with the crew back in the RV. “If something comes in that I have to answer, I use voice to text to continue my run and not break stride,” says cocaptain Kim Yee, shown here during a one-mile repeat on Death Valley Road.
Saturday, 01:47:48 p.m.Boron, Mojave Desert
By the time the team reaches the grueling 26-mile stretch known as Power Line in the late afternoon, the weather has changed, and the team is concerned about their SUV getting stuck in the mud. “We started to feel some drizzle, and then we heard the rain hitting the power lines,” says Tecson. “You could just feel this crackling sound with the wind — it sounded beautiful and scary at the same time.”
Saturday, 06:08:43 p.m.Goodsprings, Southwest Extreme Triangle
While they’re on their feet completing their segments, Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers the team’s athletes the ability to multitask. “As a runner, there’s so much going on,” says Tecson, pictured here waiting for teammate Cun. “You’re also concerned about everyone else, but you can also see through the watch that it got executed and checked off the list.”
Saturday, 06:23:10 p.m.Jean, Southwest Extreme Triangle
Silhouetted against the backdrop of the desert mountains along State Route 161 — still capped in snow after a brief storm hours earlier — Jenny Peng finishes another segment. As the team delves deeper into the Mojave Desert, they rely on the precision dual-frequency GPS of Apple Watch Ultra 2, which provides precise distance, pace, and route data. “Having GPS dial in quickly so you can just tag and go was really critical,” says Will Eckman.
Saturday, 07:05:16 p.m.Jean, Southwest Extreme Triangle
As night falls along the California-Nevada border, fatigue starts to set in for all of the runners, including Peng.
Saturday, 07:26:07 p.m.Sloan, Southwest Extreme Triangle
With Las Vegas and its bright lights slowly coming into sight, Will Eckman stretches and prepares to embark on his final one-mile segment.
Saturday, 09:53:40 p.m.Las Vegas, Southwest Extreme Triangle
On Saturday evening, the KRC x OMRC team crosses the Speed Project finish line in Las Vegas, with a final time of 41 hours and 51 minutes — cue the celebratory champagne shower, a well-deserved real shower, a hot meal, and a comfy hotel bed. “I love doing this race because you get to see what the human spirit is capable of,” says Le. “You see people go through their lows and really struggle to get out of their rock bottom in that moment to show up for each other and show up for themselves, and do something a previous version of themselves would have never thought was possible.”

Vision Pro uses a wide range of advanced machine learning and AI models to enable foundational capabilities such as hand tracking, room mapping, Personas, and more. All of this is accelerated by the Neural Engine in the M2 chip, which ensures spatial computing is the most powerful way for a business to leverage AI.
Developers have been building apps for Apple Vision Pro across numerous enterprise categories, from business productivity and product design, to immersive training and guided work.
Customized Workspaces for Productivity
Spatial computing blends digital content with the physical world, providing an infinite canvas that enables businesses to reinvent workspaces and enhance everyday productivity. With visionOS, apps are freed from the boundaries of a display, so they can appear side by side at any scale. With support for Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, users can set up the perfect workspace and bring the powerful capabilities of their Mac into Apple Vision Pro wirelessly, creating an enormous, private, and portable 4K display with incredibly crisp text. The most-loved productivity apps for business are now available on Vision Pro.
SAP Analytics Cloudhelps streamline the process of gathering, integrating, analyzing, and presenting data-driven insights to enhance business decision-making. On Apple Vision Pro, the app enables employees and executives to immediately access their data dashboard and arrange their most critical business workflows, apps, and cards beautifully in their space. They can also drill down into the data with contextual 3D maps and graphics to gain new insights. With thelatest SDK release for developers, the SAP Business Technology Platform fully supports Apple Vision Pro. Customers and partners can now deploy their SAP apps to Vision Pro, alongside iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.
“Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device, and we are thrilled to leverage the capabilities of spatial computing with SAP Analytics Cloud and SAP Mobile Start,” said Philipp Herzig, chief AI officer, SAP SE. “Going forward, we see the power of visionOS combined with generative AI being a force multiplier for enterprises. SAP Analytics Cloud running on Apple Vision Pro will help our customers discover all-new insights from complex data with powerful and intuitive processes that supercharge their business planning. And with SAP Mobile Start, we provide access to all of SAP’s business applications and workflows in unimaginable ways.”
Microsoft 365productivityapps and AI companion Copilot built for Apple Vision Pro can help users get more done in powerful new ways. Focus mode in Word allows users to write without distraction; graph, manipulate, and visualize data in sharp, crisp detail in Excel; and immerse themselves in a slideshow with PowerPoint. Switching between meetings, chats, and shared content is easy in Teams — along with accessing the assistance of Copilot — with life-size windows that can be arranged in the user’s space.
“Spatial computing has enabled us to rethink how professionals can be productive and work intelligently with the power of AI,” said Nicole Herskowitz, vice president, Microsoft 365 and Teams. “With Microsoft 365 and Teams on Apple Vision Pro, your office moves with you, allowing users to view apps side by side on an infinite canvas with spatial computing for incredible multitasking and collaboration.”
Additional apps in business productivity include:
Design and Collaboration
The display system on Apple Vision Pro packs 23 million pixels across two displays — or more than 4K resolution for each eye — which makes videos, images, and documents crystal clear from any angle. With crisp visualization of 3D content, spatial computing opens up opportunities for product design, retail planning, and construction modeling, and enables new experiences for customers to engage with products and services.
ThePorsche Race Engineerappprovides an entirely new way for the Porsche team to collaborate. Race engineers are constantly making real-time decisions about everything from the performance of the car to the driver’s vitals. Apple Vision Pro helps engineers visualize car data in real time, bringing critical metrics like speed and braking alongside track conditions and car positioning, combined with live video from the car’s dashboard. In February, Porsche broke the U.S. record for electric vehicles at Laguna Seca with the new Porsche Taycan Turbo GT, while the engineers tracked along using Vision Pro. This can also expand track experiences for fans around the world.
“At Porsche, we’ve always been driven by dreams, and Apple Vision Pro has enabled us to reimagine track experiences,” said Oliver Blume, Porsche’s CEO. “The new Porsche Taycan Turbo GT is the ultimate all-electric performance car, and, fittingly, we were thrilled to bring the best of German engineering and Apple’s inspiring product innovation together with the Race Engineer app. This is the perfect example of our team delivering on our goal to bring the best user experience to our employees and customers.”
Design and manufacturing processes are complex and involve large amounts of data from various sources.NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud APIslet developers stream massive 3D engineering and simulation data sets from the cloud to Apple Vision Pro. The high-resolution displays and powerful sensors built into Vision Pro enable developers and designers to create detailed, immersive renderings and visuals that can be viewed and manipulated in real time.
“The world’s industries are racing to build digital twins of products, facilities, and processes to better test and optimize designs well before constructing them in the physical world,” said Rev Lebaredian, NVIDIA’s vice president of Omniverse and Simulation Technology. “Enterprises can now combine the power and capabilities of Apple Vision Pro and the physically accurate renderings of OpenUSD content with NVIDIA accelerated computing to power the next generation of immersive digital experiences.”
Additional apps in design and collaboration include:
Training and Simulation
From preparing technicians to install equipment, to teaching complex tasks requiring hundreds of hours of hands-on work, making training procedures more interactive and impactful is critical to employee success. When it comes to aircraft maintenance, taking a plane offline for training can be costly and cause delays throughout the system.KLM Royal Dutch Airlineswill dramatically improve technical maintenance and airline operations with spatial computing on Apple Vision Pro. The Engine Shop app enables technicians to train on the latest engine models in full fidelity in their own space. With this app, a technician can instantly see the entire task they need to perform step by step, with detailed repair instructions overlayed on a 3D model of the exact engine. This reduces errors and increases employee job satisfaction while saving valuable time and ultimately speeding up plane turnaround times.
“We see Apple Vision Pro as a tremendous value-add that will improve our fleet availability and operations,” said Bob Tulleken, KLM’s vice president of Operations Decision Support. “Training our employees with spatial computing will lead to fewer costly errors because the most current information they need to do their job is there in front of them as they perform the task. This means we not only get vastly more efficient in our work, but also provide a better work environment for our employees to succeed.”
Additional apps in training and simulation include:
Guided Work
Guided work requires the context of a person’s surroundings, such as a utility service technician who needs access to work orders or schematics.Resolvehas reimagined how building engineers can plan for and access information they need to make decisions about systems behind walls, including HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and fire sprinkler lines. Rather than use static paper plans, users can review high-detail plans and 3D models on Apple Vision Pro, enabling architects, builders, and maintenance workers to see, fix, and comment, enhancing the entire life cycle of a construction project.
In emergency response scenarios, incident management software combines real-time and historical information with geospatial data to help first responders manage their people and fleet resources. TheFireOpsapp, developed by About Objects and DigitalCM, marks a turning point in emergency response management. FireOps leverages the infinite canvas with visionOS to provide a unified operational view of incident action plans, dramatically streamlining over a dozen procedures. This enhances coordination and decision-making among all participants, and ensures that first responders are more connected, informed, and prepared than ever before.
Additional apps in guided work include:
Apple offers developers a variety of resources, including powerful APIs, rich documentation, global developer labs,Develop in Swift Tutorials, and the visionOS simulator to help companies bring game-changing Apple Vision Pro experiences to life. To further support developers, today Apple is announcing the Enterprise Spatial Design Lab, providing hands-on support from Apple to help enterprises bring apps from concept to reality. The immersive sessions will be available beginning this summer atdeveloper.apple.com. In addition, Deloitte announced today it is expanding itsApple practiceto include anew Academy for Apple Vision Pro. The practice includes more than 100 practitioners trained to deliver visionOS solutions to clients, with a series of one-week, instructor-led courses to help engineers, product managers, and business leaders prepare for the new era of spatial computing.

UPDATE
Apple to expand repair options with support for used genuine parts
New parts calibration process will begin this fall; Activation Lock to limit use of parts from lost or stolen devices
Today Apple announced an upcoming enhancement to existing repair processes that will enable customers and independent repair providers to utilize used Apple parts in repairs. Beginning with select iPhone models this fall, the new process is designed to maintain an iPhone user’s privacy, security, and safety, while offering consumers more options, increasing product longevity, and minimizing the environmental impact of a repair. Used genuine Apple parts will now benefit from the full functionality and security afforded by the original factory calibration, just like new genuine Apple parts.
“At Apple, we’re always looking for new ways to deliver the best possible experience for our customers while reducing the impact we have on the planet, and a key part of that means designing products that last,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “For the last two years, teams across Apple have been innovating on product design and manufacturing to support repairs with used Apple parts that won’t compromise users’ safety, security, or privacy. With this latest expansion to our repair program, we’re excited to be adding even more choice and convenience for our customers, while helping to extend the life of our products and their parts.”
The process of confirming whether or not a repair part is genuine and gathering information about the part — often referred to as “pairing” — is critical to preserving the privacy, security, and safety of iPhone. Apple teams have been hard at work over the last two years to enable the reuse of parts such as biometric sensors used for Face ID or Touch ID, and beginning this fall, calibration for genuine Apple parts, new or used, will happen on device after the part is installed. In addition, future iPhone releases will have support for used biometric sensors. And in order to simplify the repair process, customers and service providers will no longer need to provide a device’s serial number when ordering parts from the Self Service Repair Store for repairs not involving replacement of the logic board.
Apple will also extend its popular Activation Lock feature to iPhone parts in order to deter stolen iPhones from being disassembled for parts. Requested by customers and law enforcement officials, the feature was designed to limit iPhone theft by blocking a lost or stolen iPhone from being reactivated. If a device under repair detects that a supported part was obtained from another device with Activation Lock or Lost Mode enabled, calibration capabilities for that part will be restricted.
As device longevity increases, Apple believes it’s important that a device’s second or third owners have access to its full part and repair histories. With Parts and Service history, located within Settings on iOS, Apple is the only smartphone company that transparently shows owners whether their device has been repaired and provides information about the parts used. This fall, Apple will expand Parts and Service History to additionally show whether a part is a new or used genuine Apple part.
This upcoming enhancement to Apple’s repair processes is another step forward in the company’s commitment to improving access to safe and affordable repairs. In the last five years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to genuine Apple parts, tools, and training to more than 10,000 Independent Repair Providers and Apple Authorized Service Providers. For those who have the relevant experience repairing electronic devices, Self Service Repair gives access to the manuals, genuine Apple parts, and tools used at Apple Store and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations. Launched in 2022, Self Service Repair now supports 40 Apple products in 33 countries and regions, and 24 languages.

UPDATE
Apple Developer Academy expands to Bali
Indonesia welcomes its fourth academy in the country as Apple deepens its investment in students and aspiring developers
Today Apple announced it will open Indonesia’s fourth Apple Developer Academy in Bali, expanding on its investment to increase opportunities for developers, students, and entrepreneurs looking to embark on careers in the region’s growing iOS app economy.
Since Indonesia’s first Apple Developer Academy launched in Jakarta in 2018, Apple has opened academies in Surabaya and Batam, and more than 2,000 aspiring developers have completed the program. As a testament to the academy’s impact, 90 percent of its graduates have gone on to find meaningful employment in various sectors spanning education, e-commerce, transportation, sustainability, and more.
“We’ve seen many times over that a line of code can change the world — and in Indonesia, we’re investing in the creativity and skills of people determined to prove it,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re excited by the growing developer community in Indonesia, and we look forward to investing in the success of even more coders with our fourth academy in the country.”
The academy’s nine-month program covers the basics of coding, as well as areas such as design, marketing, and project management, empowering students with the full suite of skills needed to become world-class entrepreneurs and developers. To encourage cross-cultural exchange, the Bali campus will accept applications not just from Indonesia, but across the globe, regardless of educational background or coding experience.
The academies in Indonesia have welcomed students from a variety of personal and professional backgrounds. To date, the cohorts have comprised students from over 90 cities across Indonesia, ranging between 18 and 50 years old, each of whom brings new ideas and life experiences to app designs and business plans.
Mary Santoso, who joined the academy in 2022 at the age of 38, foundedWonderJack, a neurodiverse-friendly iPad game that trains executive function and mental processes for children. Inspired by her experience witnessing members of her family with dyslexia, the iPad app includes a soothing soundtrack, and tactile cards and objects so children can enjoy a stress-free, multisensory learning experience. The team is now collaborating with educational institutions, including an inclusive school in Surabaya, to research and assess the impact of the app.
“As a stay-at-home mom, the Apple Developer Academy helped me transform and focus on my mission to help children facing learning challenges that are similar to ones my daughter faces,” Santoso says. “There, I found a team of learners from different backgrounds who shared my passion for education and inclusivity. The guidance from mentors helped us hone our problem-solving skills and equipped us with the tools to build WonderJack, an app that aims to unlock the potential of all children.”
The academy’s curriculum reflects Apple’s approach to Challenge Based Learning, encouraging students to address personal, community, and global challenges, while designing inclusively to make a positive impact in the world.
Alumni Graciela Gabrielle, Jessi Febria, and Yafonia Hutabarat came together at the Jakarta academy to build Indonesia’s first indoor navigation app to assist blind and low-vision users with independent travel. The app,PetaNetra, uses augmented reality paths to provide the safest and fastest routes, considering features such as walls, floor patterns, and other objects. The team has secured partnerships with major institutions, including the Jakarta Library, to map their spaces and improve its features.
“I’m truly blessed to have found supportive and committed teammates at the academy,” explains Gabrielle, PetaNetra’s co-founder and CEO, whose parents are visually impaired. “As three female founders, we are passionate about creating social impact with the work we do. This inspired us to create PetaNetra, a gift for my parents and the 4 million visually impaired in Indonesia.”
Southeast Asia is home to hundreds of thousands of developers behind more than 90,000 apps on the App Store. Beyond creating their own startups in Indonesia, many academy graduates have also gone on to join established companies throughout the region, contributing to the development of apps and digital products with skills gained at the academies.
Alumni Denis Wibisono and Rais Mohamad Najib now lead the iOS development team for Bank Mandiri, the largest bank in Indonesia. Through their work, they push the boundaries to ensure a seamless, market-leading mobile banking experience for millions of Indonesians, and almost 40 percent of the bank’s iOS development team are academy graduates.
“Being at the academy really fueled my passion for iOS app development,” says Wibisono. “I believe the experience not only equipped me with advanced coding skills, but also critical thinking training, both of which are essential qualities of professional tech engineers.”
Alumni can also participate in other Apple educational programs and resources, such as the Apple Developer Center in Singapore and Apple Entrepreneur Camp which offer additional mentorship, inspiration, and insights from Apple experts and engineers.
Since the first Apple Developer Academy opened in Brazil, the program has grown to more locations around the world, including Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Italy, and the U.S.

2024-04-17,Decrease,Apple ramps up investment in clean energy and water around the world,"Text of this article
April 17, 2024
UPDATE
Apple ramps up investment in clean energy and water around the world
Together, Apple and suppliers are supporting over 18 gigawatts of clean energy and delivering billions of gallons in water benefits and savings
Apple today announced new progress to expand clean energy around the world and advance momentum toward Apple 2030, the company’s bold goal to be carbon neutral across its entire value chain by the end of this decade. More than 18 gigawatts of clean electricity now power Apple’s global operations and manufacturing supply chain, more than triple the amount in 2020. Apple is making new investments in solar power in the U.S. and Europe to help address the electricity customers use to charge and power their Apple devices.
As part of its broader environmental efforts, Apple also advanced progress toward another ambitious 2030 goal: to replenish 100 percent of the fresh water used in corporate operations in high-stress locations. This includes launching new partnerships to deliver nearly 7 billion gallons in water benefits — from restoring aquifers and rivers, to funding access to drinking water — over the next 20 years. As with clean energy, Apple has extended its commitment to clean water across the entire supply chain: Together, Apple suppliers saved over 12 billion gallons of fresh water last year, for a total of 76 billion gallons in water savings since the company launched its Supplier Clean Water Program in 2013.
“Clean energy and water are foundational to healthy communities and essential building blocks for a responsible business,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’re racing toward our ambitious Apple 2030 climate goal while taking on the long-term work to transform electrical grids and restore watersheds to build a cleaner future for all.”
Adding New Renewable Capacity Around the World
Electricity — both to manufacture Apple products and to charge and power them — makes up the largest portion of Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint. As part of Apple 2030, the company has called on its global suppliers to use clean electricity and become carbon neutral across all their Apple-related operations. Over320 suppliers — representing 95 percent of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend — have led the way in the transition so far, resulting in 16.5 gigawatts of renewable energy online in Apple’s supply chain today. This generated over 25.5 million megawatt-hours of clean energy across the supply chain last year, avoiding over 18.5 million metric tons of carbon emissions.
To address the greenhouse gas emissions associated with customers using their devices, Apple has pledged to match every watt of charging electricity with clean electricity by 2030, including through large-scale investments in new renewable energy in markets around the world. This is part of a broader strategy to minimize emissions from the use of Apple products through efficiency improvements, engaging with customers around opportunities to decarbonize the grid, and building clean electricity projects that maximize carbon reductions and social impact. In the U.S., Apple is investing in a portfolio of solar projects across Michigan, with construction underway to bring 132 megawatts of clean energy online later this year. In Spain, Apple has partnered with international solar development platform ib vogt on an investment that will generate 105 megawatts of solar power when the project comes online by the end of 2024.
To address its growing corporate operations in India, Apple has also embarked on a joint venture with leading renewable developer CleanMax to invest in a portfolio of six rooftop solar projects with a total size of 14.4 megawatts. The added capacity provides a local solution to power Apple’s offices, its two retail stores in the country, and other operations in India. Apple first achieved 100 percent renewable energy for its global corporate operations in 2018.
Apple’s commitment to renewable energy has unlocked new capacity in markets around the world. In 2018, Apple took an innovative approach to connect 12 of its suppliers operating in China with renewable energy sources through the China Clean Energy Fund. The Fund has now exceeded its goal, with investments resulting in over 1 gigawatt of new wind and solar projects in China across 14 provinces. In aggregate, these projects are expected to deliver over 2,400 gigawatt-hours of renewable energy each year, equivalent to the residential power consumption of over 2.5 million people in China.
Advancing Water Resilience Through Nature-Based Solutions
Apple aims to advance water security everywhere its business reaches through collaboration across the manufacturing supply chain and innovative long-term partnerships to restore ecosystems, address community water needs, and improve climate resilience of watersheds. Since water impacts are felt locally, Apple has initiated fresh water replenishment work in some of the highest-stress locations where the company operates — including Northern and Southern California, Arizona’s Colorado River Basin, and the Indian states of Telangana and Maharashtra. Modeled after the company’s approach to renewable energy procurement, Apple is pursuing innovative strategies and long-term contracts aimed at delivering water benefits and savings across entire watersheds. Since 2023, Apple has so far committed over $8 million to replenishing fresh water in high-stress watersheds. The projects announced today are expected to deliver a combined 6.9 billion gallons of water benefits over the next two decades.
In Northern California, Apple is working with River Partners to restore the natural function of the flood plain on 750 acres where the Sacramento River, Feather River, and Butte Creek meet. This confluence of waterways — the largest in California — offers a critical resting point for native Chinook salmon along their path to the Pacific Ocean. Restoring the area will involve planting hundreds of thousands of native plants and reconnecting the vast historic flood plain, making the region and downstream communities more resilient to climate-driven flooding. Apple’s investment is expected to leverage nearly 5 billion gallons of freshwater benefits over 20 years by significantly reducing water demand on the property and encouraging healthy flood patterns to recharge underground aquifers. The restoration of Dos Rios Norte is also funded by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the California Natural Resources Agency, the California Wildlife Conservation Board, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.
In the greater Phoenix area, home to Apple’s Mesa data center, Apple is working with Salt River Project (SRP) to protect approximately 30,000 acres of forest at severe risk of wildfire. With a 10-year plan to strategically thin forests in the Colorado River Basin, the project will help protect the watershed from being devastated by wildfires and ensure the upstream reservoir can continue to support local communities. Apple’s investment — the largest investment with SRP’s Resilient Water and Forest Initiative — is expected to deliver nearly 2 billion gallons of water benefits in the area.
Last year, Apple achieved its target for 100 percent water replenishment for the company’s corporate operations in India through its ongoing work with Uptime Catalyst Facility. In 2023, Apple’s support provided 23 million gallons of clean, affordable drinking water to communities from over 300 water kiosks run by local entrepreneurs in the innovative performance-based program. Progress in another critical region — Southern California — continues with a project to remove the invasive Arundo donax cane species in the Los Angeles River Watershed, saving 21 million gallons of water annually.
In addition to pursuing watershed restoration and other nature-based replenishment solutions in high-stress areas, Apple is committed to smart water stewardship across the business. In 2021, Apple’s data center in Prineville, Oregon, became the first-ever data center certified to the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) International Water Stewardship Standard, a trusted global framework for measuring responsible water stewardship. Since then, Apple has certified four additional data centers to the Standard and supported 20 supplier sites in achieving certification as well. In the past year, seven supplier sites in southern India and over 20 supplier sites near Shanghai and Suzhou in China have participated in water stewardship training with AWS and others in the industry.
Accelerating Progress Through Green Investments
In the U.S. and around the world, Apple’s Green Bonds have also helped make these new investments possible. Last year, Apple allocated proceeds from its 2019 Green Bond toward new clean energy projects like the new solar projects in Michigan and the IP Radian Solar project in Texas, support for the Supplier Clean Energy Program, and investments in high-quality carbon removal through the Restore Fund.

UPDATE
Apple cuts greenhouse gas emissions in half
Innovations in clean energy, materials, and recycling are driving progress toward Apple’s ambitious environmental goals
Apple has reduced its overall greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55 percent since 2015, the company shared today in its2024 Environmental Progress Report. The milestone marks important progress on the journey toward Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain by the end of this decade. The goal centers on cutting emissions by 75 percent from 2015 levels.
“The proof of Apple’s commitment to climate action is in our progress: We’ve slashed emissions by more than half, all while serving more users than ever before,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “More hard work is ahead of us, and we’re focused on harnessing the power of innovation and collaboration to maximize our impact.”
Teams across Apple and its global supply chain have contributed to Apple 2030 and the company’s environmental efforts, driving innovations in clean energy and energy efficiency, materials, carbon removal, water stewardship, zero waste, and recycling. As Apple celebrates Earth Day with its customers around the world — including through curated environment-focused collections onpodcasts,books, and more — here’s a look at 10 innovations, partnerships, and activities engaging customers and advancing global climate and environmental progress.
Paving the Way for Recycled Critical Materials
Apple’s work toward making products using only recycled and renewable materials has spurred innovation in sourcing and design — while driving major reductions in the company’s carbon footprint. This includes materials critical to the clean energy transition. Last year, 56 percent of the cobalt shipped in Apple batteries came from recycled sources, more than double the year before.1That includes the MacBook Air with M3, the first-ever Apple product to be made with 50 percent recycled material. And in another first, 24 percent of the lithium shipped in Apple batteries last year came from certified recycled sources. For both lithium and cobalt, Apple is sourcing from post-industrial scrap and post-consumer scrap from end-of-life batteries. The company has also made strides with copper, using 100 percent recycled copper in key thermal applications in iPhone 15 and the 16-inch MacBook Pro, as well as the Taptic Engine and printed circuit boards across many product lines in the last year. The progress demonstrates real potential for recycling to help meet the growing demand for critical materials in the future.
Slashing Manufacturing Emissions with Suppliers
The ongoing transition to clean electricity across Apple’s supply chain has driven the majority of emissions reductions so far, with Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program now supporting over 16.5 gigawatts of renewable energy around the world. And by prioritizing energy efficiency in collaboration with Apple, more than 100 supplier facilities achieved over 2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity savings last year. Together with additional energy savings — primarily associated with heat — these facilities avoided nearly 1.7 million metric tons of carbon emissions, up 25 percent from 2022. Apple is also working to address the direct climate impact of industrial processes, such as the manufacturing of flat-panel displays, which emits highly potent fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs). Every display supplier has committed to a high standard of F-GHG abatement, and Apple is engaging with them to track emissions and deploy state-of-the-art abatement equipment at manufacturing sites.
Designing to Remove Plastic
Apple’s journey to remove plastic from its packaging is fueled by innovation, using fiber-based plastic alternatives that still provide an unmatched unboxing experience for customers. In the last year, Apple reached a milestone with the release of its first-ever 100 percent fiber-based packaging in the new Apple Watch lineup and for Apple Vision Pro. Across every product Apple shipped last year, only 3 percent of the packaging was made from plastic. Teams continue to innovate — this week, Apple published a new white paper with theUniversity of British Columbia’s BioProducts Institutethat analyzes the challenges with current consumer packaging and explores more sustainable future solutions through the use of advanced fiber-based materials. And in partnership withRISE Research Institutes of Sweden, Apple announced the development of a fiber-based alternative to the protective foams widely used in many types of packaging.
Partnering with Communities to Drive Change
As Apple accelerates work to address climate change, the company is also focused on supporting efforts led by communities experiencing disproportionate impacts. Through its Strengthen Local Communities program, Apple is providing a series of new grants to organizations worldwide that are taking action to protect the health and wellbeing of their communities. In the U.S., Apple is also supporting the growth of Justice Outside’s Network for Network Leaders program to promote the outdoors, environmental education, and environmental justice. Apple has also worked with the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya to support water harvesting and climate-smart agriculture by funding a rainwater catchment system at the Lewa school in Mutunyi and drip irrigation kits for farmers working to encourage more sustainable agriculture practices in their communities. This year, the company will build on this work with new support for Lewa’s community water access programs. And in Australia, Apple will extend its funding for the Karrkad Kanjdji Trust (KKT), an organization led by the traditional owners of Warddeken and Djelk Indigenous protected areas. Apple’s grant will support KKT’s Indigenous Women Rangers Program and conservation activities across the protected areas.
Spurring Industrywide Change with Reusable Filters
As part of the company’s commitment to zero waste, last year Apple completed the installation of reusable air filters at every one of its data centers worldwide. The shift avoids sending 25 tons of dirty filters to landfills each year — enough to fill an entire football field — and cuts fan energy use by 35 percent. Working together beginning in 2019 at Apple’s Reno data center, Apple and automotive filtration and technology company K&N prototyped and tested 20 versions of an all-new reusable filter design to meet high standards of performance and efficiency. Today the reusable filters are quickly becoming standard, not just for Apple but industrywide. Innovations like this have contributed to significant progress: In the last five years, Apple increased the diversion rate from its data centers from 64 percent to 90 percent.
Innovating for the Future of Recycling
Apple has engineered entirely new technologies to advance the field of electronics recycling — including disassembly robot Daisy, which can now take apart 29 models of iPhone into 15 discrete components, and recycling machines Dave and Taz, which are now deployed with a recycling partner in China. This year, Apple introduced a new product sorter to its asset recovery center in California, with the goal of automating the process to improve efficiency and productivity. Apple is committed to sharing the technology with recycling partners around the world as a low-cost, time-saving solution. As an additional efficiency improvement, the asset recovery center now employs autonomous mobile robots to help transport products and components around the facility. Through academic partnerships with institutions such as Carnegie Mellon, the company is also working to further harness the power of artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and automation in recycling.
Building for a Greener Future
Apple’s commitment to design with the environment in mind extends beyond products and includes the construction of its buildings. Today, more than 100 of Apple’s retail stores, corporate offices, and data centers worldwide are certified through Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), and Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), two internationally respected accreditation processes for sustainable buildings. The number continues to grow — currently, Apple is developing more than 18 million square feet of green building space globally. In 2023, a building in Apple’s Culver City, California, campus achieved LEED Platinum status, the highest possible rating, for significant energy and water savings, renewable power, and waste diversion. And the new Apple Battersea campus and retail store, located in London’s historic Battersea Power Station, diverted 99 percent of construction waste from landfill, while employing sustainable design elements and low-carbon materials.
Investing in Nature with High-Quality Carbon Removal Projects
In the roadmap to achieve its Apple 2030 climate goal, Apple is prioritizing direct emissions reductions across all operations and its supply chain. For residual emissions that are difficult to avoid with today’s available solutions, the company is investing in high-quality, nature-based carbon projects, including through its innovativeRestore Fund. Building on a strong portfolio of sustainable forestry projects in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, Apple has launched a new phase of the Restore Fund with Climate Asset Management, focused on creating a portfolio that pools regenerative agriculture projects with ecosystem conservation and restoration projects. This year, Apple suppliers TSMC and Murata joined the fund’s second phase with their own investment commitments. And today Apple is announcing the first set of regenerative agriculture projects the fund has invested in, which includes the development of olive and almond farms in Portugal, an almond farm in Spain, and a farm in Australia that is being converted from sugarcane to macadamias. The projects adhere to strict protocols to ensure water security and efficiency, and employ proven measures to improve soil quality and promote biodiversity.
Engaging Customers and Employees in Global Recycling
Last year, nearly 12.8 million devices and accessories were sent to new owners through AppleCare and programs like Apple Trade In — more than ever before. As of today, iPhone 7 still offers Trade In value. Apple will responsibly recycle products that no longer have value, and recover the valuable materials inside so they can live a new life in future products. From reboxing old devices to send back to Apple, to organizing a collection drive, to simply passing on an old iPhone to a family member, there are so many ways customers can contribute to Apple’s environmental goals. Customers can drop off their used Apple devices at any Apple Store location, or by visitingapple.com/recycle.
Celebrating Earth Day with Education and Action
Across Apple’s ecosystem, the company is offering opportunities for users to educate themselves on climate change and other environmental issues, take meaningful action in their communities, and celebrate Earth Day. On April 22, Apple Watch users can earn a limited-edition award by completing any workout of 30 minutes or more.
Customers can also attend Today at Apple programming featuring environmental leaders and visionary organizations in select Apple Store locations worldwide. In all stores globally, Apple Retail will also host a Pop-Up Studio titled Photograph Earth Like a Pro on iPhone, demoing features like macro photography and more on iPhone 15. This year, Apple will again collaborate with Dolores Huerta, social justice advocate and founder of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, as part of the Challenge for Change learning series. Learners of all ages can participate in the challengeCreate a Better World Through Environmental Justice, which offers thought-provoking discussion guides. And a new resource — 30 Creative Activities to Help the Environment — is designed to inspire new ways for people to take action in their communities.
On Earth Day and every day, Apple is committed to taking action to protect the planet and to inspire others — including Apple customers — to do the same.

UPDATE
Apple launches “Made for Business” in select stores around the world
Apple introduces a new series of Today at Apple programming for small business owners and entrepreneurs
Beginning in May, a special Today at Apple series titled “Made for Business” will offer small business owners and entrepreneurs free opportunities to learn how Apple products and services can support their growth and success. Led by small business owners, the sessions will highlight how these organizations have used Apple products such as iPhone, iPad, and Mac — along with resources such as Apple Business Connect, Apple Business Essentials, and Tap to Pay on iPhone — to build their businesses, reach customers in new ways, and push their organizations forward.
“At Apple, we know small businesses are the backbone of local communities, which is why we are constantly innovating to help at every stage of their growth,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s senior vice president of Retail. “Our retail stores provide only-at-Apple experiences such as community and education sessions, free Today at Apple programming, and ongoing support from in-store experts who help small businesses find the perfect technology to supercharge their work.”
“Made for Business” Programming
Kicking off during National Small Business Week in the U.S., Today at Apple will offer six “Made for Business” sessions throughout May in Chicago, Miami, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., with ongoing programming in select stores around the world throughout the year. Led by small business owners with diverse and unique stories, the sessions will highlight how Apple products and services have powered their businesses’ success.
One of those businesses is Washington, D.C.-based Mozzeria, a Deaf-owned pizzeria founded with a mission to provide customers with a warm, memorable, and visually captivating experience of Deaf culture. During the session at Apple Carnegie Library, Theodore Miller, Mozzeria’s director of National Operations, will demonstrate how the restaurant’s staff leverages Apple’s accessibility features to help break down barriers and empower the business.
“To build a truly inclusive and community-driven business, we must focus on putting people first. That means adapting our technology and practices to be more accessible. Apple’s innovations have been key in helping us boost efficiency and connect with customers,” said Miller. “Whether it’s using Dictation on iPhone or iPad for speech to text in the Notes app, or enabling Live Captions for phone calls, Apple’s tools help bridge communication gaps and set higher standards for businesses in today’s fast-paced world.”
Resources for Businesses
In Apple Store locations, dedicated business teams, known as Business Pros and Business Experts, are available to support small businesses at every stage of their growth. Whether a business owner is looking to learn which products and services are right for their team, or interested in expanding their use of Apple’s tools, Business Pros can help curate personalized solutions, facilitate easy purchasing and shipping, and help small businesses get set up with Apple resources, including:
Apple technology is woven into the fabric of small businesses, and has enabled design and manufacturing company Sock Club to grow from a small subscription service into a bespoke textile company.
“We’re excited to be in a period of rapid growth. Apple is a key enabler of that,” said Noah Lee, Sock Club’s co-founder.
The small business relies on Business Essentials to deploy and configure the company’s entire fleet of Apple devices from Texas to North Carolina remotely — allowing the team to concentrate on the business, not tech support.
“Apple Business Essentials offers a platform to scale business operations, making onboarding new employees and setting up new Apple devices fast and easy,” said Max Williamson, Sock Club’s vice president of Customer Success and Strategic Partnerships.
Dedicated in-store teams and purpose-built tools for business are just some of the ways that Apple is supporting companies of all sizes and in every region of the globe. No matter where a business is on their journey, Apple has the tools to help.
Available year-round, Today at Apple also provides sessions for business teams or colleagues through group reservations. Businesses can get started with new devices, explore new skills and tools together with a dedicated expert, and discover what Apple’s latest products can do for their business. Attendees can sign up atapple.com/today/groups.

UPDATE
Meet three Swift Student Challenge winners who were inspired by their families to change the future through coding
Apple’s annual Swift Student Challenge recognizes the best in student coding, and this year, it has added a new category to its ranks. Out of 350 winning submissions, 50 students have been named Distinguished Winners for building app playgrounds that stand out for their innovation, creativity, social impact, or inclusivity. These 50 students have been invited to a three-day in-person experience at Apple Park that includes tailored programming and the special event at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), where they’ll join like-minded creators from all over the world.
“This year’s winning Swift Student Challenge submissions once again demonstrate the breadth and depth of what is possible when talented young people use coding to make their mark on the world,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “We’re also incredibly proud to welcome more outstanding student developers than ever before to Apple Park to connect with our teams and each other as they continue to build apps that will no doubt transform our future for the better.”
This year’s winners come from all over the globe, representing more than 35 countries and regions. Many of their app playgrounds were sparked by something personal, such as helping people in their community or a favorite hobby. For Distinguished Winners Elena Galluzzo, Dezmond Blair, and Jawaher Shaman, inspiration also came from their families — and they share the hope that one day, their apps can make an impact on others as well.
Elena Galluzzo, 22, divides her time between Waterloo, Ontario, where she’s finishing her undergraduate degree at Wilfrid Laurier University, and her family home in the suburbs of Toronto. She shares that home with her parents, her sister, and her maternal grandparents, who were the inspiration for her winning app, Care Capsule.
“My grandmother is in the late stages of Alzheimer’s disease and requires full-time care,” says Galluzzo. “And it’s also hard on my grandfather because it can be quite lonely — even though he lives with his children and grandchildren, a lot of older people don’t. Canada has an aging population, so I think it’s really important to keep looking into ways we can help people in this field, and coding is one way I can contribute.”
Galluzzo designed Care Capsule to be an all-in-one assistant for elderly people. She used Apple’s machine learning framework Create ML to build a chatbot that analyzes interactions with the user to deduce whether they are experiencing loneliness or depression. The app also lets users track their medications, connect with community resources, and keep a record of positive memories.
After Galluzzo graduates with a degree in business this spring, she hopes to publish Care Capsule on the App Store, potentially incorporating what she learns when she attends WWDC24 in June.
“Being able to meet other people who have the same passion as I do is very exciting,” she says. “I’m also really looking forward to seeing what new frameworks are coming out and how I could use them. I think it’s very cool to be able to create something that can tap into your device’s native functionality and help solve important challenges at the same time.”
Dezmond Blair, 22, grew up in Canton, Michigan, and spent a lot of his time outdoors mountain biking with his little brother. His family had a secondhand computer, but they couldn’t afford to connect it to the internet.
“After growing up in a trailer park, it became really important for me to make sure that I was keeping up on all my grades because my parents told me when I was young, ‘You’re definitely not ending up like we were,’” says Blair. “They spent a lot of their life trying to make sure that I wouldn’t have to struggle the same way they did, and so that’s where my inspiration and my passion comes from.”
He worked hard in high school and discovered he had a knack for technology, eventually getting his associate’s degree in computer programming. Last year, Blair started at the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, where he was introduced to Apple’s coding language Swift. With it, he created his winning iPad app called MTB XTREME, which puts users behind the handlebars of a mountain bike, offering a 360-degree view of the trails around them. Eventually, Blair wants to release an even more immersive version for Apple Vision Pro.
In addition to working on his own apps, Blair recently started his own company that helps to design app prototypes, which he cleverly named Easy Dez It — though his most important goal for the future comes back to his parents.
“I want to end up buying them a house one day,” says Blair. “They’ve done so much for me and my little brother, so I have to pay it forward.”
Growing up in Saudi Arabia, Jawaher Shaman was very close to her grandfather. When she was 5, he passed away, and soon after, she developed a stutter that became debilitating. Over time, and with the help of her father, she was able to learn ways to manage it and no longer stutters. Now 27 and studying at the Apple Developer Academy in Riyadh, Shaman’s winning app playground, My Child, aims to help others with speech conditions.
“My father never made me feel different, and I hope my app will do the same for any child or young person who suffers from stuttering,” says Shaman. “I don’t want them to ever feel like stuttering is a hurdle they can’t overcome.”
My Child tells Shaman’s story through the eyes of a child who stutters, and features characters inspired by her father and grandfather. The app guides users through exercises that help slow down their breathing and prepare them for real-life experiences like reading a story in class. Shaman used AVFAudio to add sounds that mimic the way her father would break sentences into small, more manageable parts.
After graduation, Shaman will work as a programmer in Saudi Arabia, and she also wants to publish My Child on the App Store and continue creating apps that assist others.
“I hope to use technology to help children who are neurodivergent because I know what it’s like to feel different,” says Shaman. “Coding for me opened up a world of possibilities, and it brings me one step closer to achieving my goals, which are to help people and create a lasting impact.”
Apple is proud to champion the next generation of developers, creators, and entrepreneurs through its annual WWDC student program. Over the past four decades, thousands of students from all over the world have built successful careers, founded businesses, and created organizations focused on democratizing technology and using it to build a better future.

Powered by artificial intelligence, the new Logic Pro introduces incredible studio assistant features that augment the music-making process and provide artists help right when they need it — all while ensuring they maintain full creative control. These features include Session Players, which expand the popular Drummer capabilities in Logic Pro to include a new Bass Player and Keyboard Player; Stem Splitter, to extract and work with individual parts of a single audio recording; and ChromaGlow, to instantly add warmth to tracks. Logic Pro for iPad 2 and Logic Pro for Mac 11 will be available on the App Store starting Monday, May 13.
“Logic Pro gives creatives everything they need to write, produce, and mix a great song, and our latest features take that creativity to a whole new level,” said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple’s senior director of Apps Worldwide Product Marketing. “Logic Pro’s new AI-backed updates, combined with the unparalleled performance of iPad, Mac, and M-series Apple silicon, provide creative pros with the best music creation experience in the industry.”
Session Players: A Personalized AI-Driven Backing Band
Session Players offer groundbreaking experiences for creators by providing a personal, AI-driven backing band that responds directly to feedback.1Drummer took the music creation industry by storm when it debuted as one of the world’s first generative musicians more than a decade ago. Today, it gets even better with key improvements and the addition of a new virtual Bass Player and Keyboard Player. Session Players augment the live-playing experience while ensuring artists maintain full agency during any phase of their music-making process.
Bass Player was trained in collaboration with today’s best bass players using advanced AI and sampling technologies. Users can choose from eight different Bass Players and guide their performance with controls for complexity and intensity, while leveraging advanced parameters for slides, mutes, dead notes, and pickup hits. Bass Player can jam along with chord progressions, or users can choose from 100 Bass Player loops to draw new inspiration. With Chord Track, users can define and edit the chord progressions to a song, and the virtual Bass Player will follow along perfectly. Plus, with Studio Bass plug-in, users gain access to six new, meticulously recorded instruments, from acoustic to electric — all inspired by the sounds of today’s most popular bass tones and genres.
With Keyboard Player, users can choose from four different styles, designed in cooperation with top studio musicians and made to accompany a wide variety of music genres. Keyboard Player can play everything from simple block chords to chord voicing with extended harmony — with nearly endless variations.

Using Studio Piano plug-in, users can select additional sound-shaping options, with the ability to adjust three mic positions, pedal noise, key noise, release samples, and sympathetic resonance.
Stem Splitter: Recover Great Recordings
Most musicians perform their best without the pressure of a formal studio session. These moments are often found in Voice Memos recordings, an old demo cassette tape, or are captured from a live show. Listening back, these recordings can reveal magical performances that are nearly impossible to re-create, making them lost to time. Now, with Stem Splitter, an artist can recover moments of inspiration from any audio file and separate nearly any mixed audio recording into four distinct parts: Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other instruments, right on the device.2With these tracks separated, it’s easy to apply effects, add new parts, or change the mix. Powered by AI and M-series Apple silicon, Stem Splitter is lightning fast.
ChromaGlow: Dial in the Perfect Tone
ChromaGlow models the sounds produced by a blend of the world’s most revered studio hardware by leveraging AI and the power of M-series Apple silicon.3Users can dial in the perfect tone with five different saturation styles to add ultrarealistic warmth, presence, and punch to any track.

The 11-inch iPad Air still starts at just $599, and the 13-inch iPad Air is a fantastic value at just $799. Customers can order the new iPad Air today, with availability beginning Wednesday, May 15.
“So many users — from students, to content creators, to small businesses, and more — love iPad Air for its performance, portability, and versatility, all at an affordable price. Today, iPad Air gets even better,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Product Marketing. “We’re so excited to introduce the redesigned 11-inch and all-new 13-inch iPad Air, offering two sizes for the first time. With its combination of a brilliant Liquid Retina display, the phenomenal performance of the M2 chip, incredible AI capabilities, and its colorful, portable design with support for new accessories, iPad Air is more powerful and versatile than ever.”
iPad Air: Now Available in Two Sizes
The redesigned 11-inch iPad Air is super-portable, perfect for getting work done on the go. For users who want a larger display, the new 13-inch iPad Air offers 30 percent more screen real estate than the 11-inch model. The expansive display gives users more space to capture their ideas in apps like Freeform, or view multiple apps using Split View in iPadOS. Both models include advanced displays with a Liquid Retina design; an anti-reflective screen coating; True Tone technology; high brightness; and support for P3 wide color, resulting in content that looks remarkably rich and vibrant, and text that is sharp in all kinds of lighting conditions.
Landscape Front-Facing Camera
In the redesigned iPad Air, the front-facing Ultra Wide 12MP camera is now located along the landscape edge. The camera features Center Stage, which uses machine learning (ML) to automatically keep everyone in the field of view. This new camera location is perfect, since it has become the most common orientation for iPad users, whether they are connecting with friends and family over FaceTime, or joining a video conference while using iPad Air in a keyboard. The 12MP Wide back camera on iPad Air delivers high-resolution photos and detailed 4K video with support for 240-fps slo-mo. Dual microphones are designed to work in unison with the cameras, capturing audio from the camera being used and minimizing distracting background noise. The new iPad Air also has landscape stereo speakers with Spatial Audio. The 13-inch model delivers even better sound quality with double the bass, which is great for enjoying music and videos.
Even More Performance with M2
The M2 chip brings another big boost in performance to iPad Air, featuring a faster 8-core CPU and 9-core GPU. M2 is a powerful chip that offers a number of improvements over M1, delivering a huge leap in performance for those upgrading from previous-generation iPad Air models. When combined with faster memory bandwidth, the new iPad Air is nearly 50 percent faster than the previous iPad Air with M1 for a wide range of productivity and creative tasks.1And compared to iPad Air with A14 Bionic, the new iPad Air delivers up to 3x faster performance. From creating engaging content faster than ever in Affinity Designer, to playing demanding, graphics-intensive games like Zenless Zone Zero, users will feel the speed of M2 in everything they do.
Powerful Device for AI
With M2, the new iPad Air is an amazing device for AI, featuring a more efficient 16-core Neural Engine that is 40 percent faster than M1. Combined with ML accelerators in the CPU and a powerful GPU to boost on-device machine learning, along with Apple silicon’s unified memory architecture, iPad Air delivers exceptional AI performance. Taking advantage of this performance, users can enjoy intelligent iPadOS features such as Visual Look Up, Subject Lift, or Live Text. iPadOS also has advanced frameworks like Core ML that make it easy for developers to tap into the Neural Engine to deliver powerful AI features right on device. With the vast ecosystem of apps that include advanced AI features, users can do things like use the Auto Enhance tool in Photomator, which improves photos with a single click using AI models, or analyze athletic performance like never before with Onform and its motion tracking capabilities. iPad Air also supports cloud-based solutions, enabling users to run advanced productivity and creative apps that tap into the power of AI, such as Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Adobe Firefly.
Faster Connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E and 5G
With faster wireless connectivity on the go, users can do even more on iPad Air. The new iPad Air supports Wi-Fi 6E, which delivers up to 2x increased performance than the previous generation, so users can download files, play games online, and stream movies. Wi-Fi + Cellular models with 5G allow users to access their files, communicate with peers, and back up their data in a snap while on the go. Cellular models of the new iPad Air are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad Air in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier.
Versatile Accessories, Including Apple Pencil Pro
Apple Pencil Pro features even more magical capabilities and powerful new interactions that take the Apple Pencil experience even further. A new sensor in the barrel can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A customhaptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.
With these advanced features, Apple Pencil Pro allows users to bring their ideas to life in entirely new ways, and developers can also create their own custom interactions. Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My to Apple Pencil for the first time, helping users locate Apple Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of iPad Air through a new magnetic interface. iPad Air also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at a great value.
iPad Air works with the Magic Keyboard, which includes a floating design, built-in trackpad, and backlit keyboard. The new Smart Folio for iPad Air attaches magnetically and now supports multiple viewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in charcoal gray, light violet, denim, and sage, the new Smart Folio complements the finishes of iPad Air.
Power of iPadOS 17
iPadOS 17 brings new levels of personalization and versatility that elevate the iPad Air experience:
Vast Ecosystem of Apps
iPad Air also comes with exceptional apps built in, including Freeform, Notes, iMovie, GarageBand, Photos, and the iWork suite of productivity apps — Pages, Numbers, and Keynote.Logic Pro for iPad 2andFinal Cut Pro for iPad 2bring new features that transform iPad Air into an even more flexible creative powerhouse.2Available Monday, May 13, Logic Pro delivers breakthrough professional experiences for songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing with powerful AI-driven features, including Session Players, ChromaGlow, and Stem Splitter. Coming later this spring, Final Cut Pro turns iPad into the ultimate mobile production studio, with Live Multicam to control and record with up to four iPhone or iPad devices with Final Cut Camera;3external project support;4and even more new content. And with over a million apps on the App Store, iPad Air users can find apps for anything they want to do, from advanced productivity to creativity.
Better for the Environment
The new iPad Air is designed with the environment in mind, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The new iPad Air meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, and PVC. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal to remove plastic from all packaging by 2025.
Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.

2024-05-13,Increase,Apple and Google deliver support for unwanted tracking alerts in iOS and Android,"Text of this article
May 13, 2024
UPDATE
Apple and Google deliver support for unwanted tracking alerts in iOS and Android
Apple and Google have worked together to create an industry specification —Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers— for Bluetooth tracking devices that makes it possible to alert users across both iOS and Android if such a device is unknowingly being used to track them. This will help mitigate the misuse of devices designed to help keep track of belongings. Today Apple is implementing this capability in iOS 17.5, and Google is now launching this capability on Android 6.0+ devices.
With this new capability, users will now get an “[Item] Found Moving With You” alert on their device if an unknown Bluetooth tracking device is seen moving with them over time, regardless of the platform the device is paired with.
If a user gets such an alert on their iOS device, it means that someone else’s AirTag, Find My accessory, or other industry specification-compatible Bluetooth tracker is moving with them. It’s possible the tracker is attached to an item the user is borrowing, but if not, iPhone can view the tracker’s identifier, have the tracker play a sound to help locate it, and access instructions to disable it. Bluetooth tag manufacturers including Chipolo, eufy, Jio, Motorola, and Pebblebee have committed that future tags will be compatible.
AirTag and third-party Find My network accessories were designed from the beginning with industry-first privacy and safety protections, and Apple has remained committed to innovating and supplementing these protections to keep consumers safe. This cross-platform collaboration — also an industry first, involving community and industry input — offers instructions and best practices for manufacturers, should they choose to build unwanted tracking alert capabilities into their products. Apple and Google will continue to work with theInternet Engineering Task Forcevia the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers working group to develop the official standard for this technology.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Music celebrates the greatest records ever made with the launch of inaugural 100 Best Albums list
A 10-day countdown kicks off today with the reveal of albums 100-91, featuring works from Solange; Tyler, The Creator; George Michael; and moreDiscover, share, and follow along as Apple Music journeys through the albums that shaped, inspired, and fundamentally changed music
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple Music today announced the release of its 100 Best Albums of all time, a celebratory list of the greatest records ever made, crafted by Apple Music’s team of experts alongside a select group of artists, including Maren Morris, Pharrell Williams, J Balvin, Charli XCX, Mark Hoppus, Honey Dijon, and Nia Archives, as well as songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement, fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music — a love letter to the records that have shaped the world music lovers live and listen in.
Apple Music is bringing its 100 Best Albums to life with a countdown celebration beginning today, revealing 10 albums each day for the next 10 days, along with a brand-new 100 Best microsite, new and exclusive content, dedicated Apple Music Radio episodes, and so much more. The countdown will culminate on the final day with the reveal of Apple Music’s top 10 albums of all time during a broadcast radio special.
“100 Best brings together all the things that make Apple Music the ultimate service for music lovers — human curation at its peak, an appreciation for the art of storytelling, and unparalleled knowledge of music and an even deeper love for it,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of content and editorial. “We have been working on this for a very long time, and it’s something we are all incredibly proud of and excited to share with the world.”
“Putting this list together was a true labor of love, both in that it was incredibly difficult to do and in that we are all so passionate about it,” said Zane Lowe, Apple Music’s global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. “We were tasked with selecting the 100 best — that’s practically mission impossible. But as music fans, it was also amazing to really take a minute and sit and think about the music and albums and artists that we love so much in this context. If this list sparks more debate among fans outside of Apple Music and gets people talking passionately about the music they love, then we’ve done what we set out to do.”
The first 10 albums, revealed today, offer a glimpse into Apple Music’s unique approach with 100 Best. With seven of the 10 records hailing from the 21st century, two from the 90s, only one from the 70s, and various genres represented, the list spotlights contemporary artists like Tyler, The Creator; Robyn; Lorde; Travis Scott; Solange; Burial; and more who have helped define this century through their music and its influence on others.

“There are so many fun facts for our listeners to discover about these albums,” said Scott Plagenhoef, Apple Music’s global head of music programming. “For example, two of the records revealed today were promoted without the image of the artist, but for opposite reasons — Burial’sUntruebecause the artist was still operating anonymously at the time, and George Michael’sListen Without Prejudice Vol. 1because the artist was actually retreating from fame.”
Discover, Learn, and Share with Friends
To accompany the list, today Apple Music also revealed a dedicated microsite that will update every day of the countdown, making it easy for listeners to follow along. Available now at100best.music.apple.com, the new 100 Best microsite spotlights in-depth analysis of each album, archival interviews, and more, and makes it easy for fans to share their favorite albums with friends and on their social channels.
Explore records 100-91 of Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums at100best.music.apple.com.
Follow Along on Apple Music Radio
Fans will also be treated to a full 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits, where round-the-clock specials with Apple Music Radio hosts and daily specials at 9 a.m. PT (noon ET) will be broadcasted, plus exclusive content will drop every day on demand on Apple Music and Apple Podcasts.
The last 10 albums will be revealed on Wednesday, May 22, with a special roundtable discussion broadcasting globally on Apple Music that features guest artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rogers reflecting on the list alongside Apple Music’s own Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden. Lowe will also curate a special mashup-style DJ mix featuring songs from all 100 Best Albums.
Apple Music will keep the momentum going after the countdown ends with an additional week of 100 Best Albums Radio takeover on Apple Music Hits.

2024-05-14,Decrease,App Store stopped over $7 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions in four years,"Text of this article
May 14, 2024
UPDATE
App Store stopped over $7 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions in four years
Since launching the App Store in 2008, Apple has continued to invest in and develop industry-leading technologies designed to provide users with the safest and most secure experience for downloading apps, and a vibrant and innovative platform for developers to distribute their software. Today, the App Store stands at the forefront of app distribution, setting the standard for security, reliability, and user experience.
As digital threats have evolved in scope and complexity over the years, Apple has expanded its antifraud initiatives to address these challenges and help protect its users. Every day, teams across Apple monitor and investigate fraudulent activity on the App Store, and utilize sophisticated tools and technologies to weed out bad actors and help strengthen the App Store ecosystem.
From 2020 through 2023, Apple prevented a combined total of over $7 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions, including more than $1.8 billion in 2023 alone. In the same period, Apple blocked over 14 million stolen credit cards and more than 3.3 million accounts from transacting again.
As published in its fourth annual fraud prevention analysis released today, Apple found that in 2023, it rejected more than 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet the App Store’s stringent standards for privacy, security, and content. In addition, Apple’s persistent efforts to stop and reduce fraud on the App Store resulted in the termination of nearly 374 million developer and customer accounts, and removal of close to 152 million ratings and reviews over fraud concerns.
Account Fraud
Apple has developed robust systems to root out fraudulent customer and developer accounts quickly and effectively to prevent such actors from defrauding users. In 2023, Apple terminated close to 118,000 developer accounts, a decrease from 428,000 terminations from the prior year, thanks to continued improvements to prevent the creation of potentially fraudulent accounts in the first place. In addition, more than 91,000 developer enrollments were rejected for fraud concerns and prevented from submitting problematic apps to the App Store.
Harmful activity can also occur at the customer account level, and Apple takes a number of measures to protect users and developers from ill-intended parties. These accounts tend to be bots that are created for the purposes of spamming or manipulating ratings and reviews, charts, and search results, which threaten the integrity of the App Store and its users and developers. In 2023, Apple blocked over 153 million fraudulent customer account creations and deactivated nearly 374 million accounts for fraud and abuse.
Apple’s commitment to trust and safety extends beyond the App Store, having detected and blocked more than 47,000 illegitimate apps on pirate storefronts from reaching users over the last 12 months. Blocking apps from pirate storefronts is also beneficial to developers, whose apps could be modified or used to disguise malicious software for distribution on these platforms.
Additionally, in the last month, Apple stopped nearly 3.8 million attempts to install or launch apps distributed illicitly through the Developer Enterprise Program, which allows large organizations to deploy internal apps for use by employees.
App Review
Apple’s App Review team of over 500 experts evaluates every single app submission — from developers around the world — before any app ever reaches users. On average, the team reviews approximately 132,500 apps a week, and in 2023, reviewed nearly 6.9 million app submissions while helping more than 192,000 developers publish their first app onto the App Store.
App Review conducts a number of checks before any app makes its way onto the store, and leverages automated processes and human review to detect and take action on apps with the potential to harm or defraud users. In 2023, more than 1.7 million app submissions were rejected for various reasons, including privacy violations and fraudulent activity.
Bad actors employ deceptive tactics to harm users, including the practice of disguising potentially risky apps as innocuous ones. Over the past year, there have been numerous instances where App Review identified apps initially misrepresented as harmless products — such as photo editors or puzzle games — that later transformed postreview into pirate movie streaming platforms, illegal gambling apps, or fraudulent and predatory loan issuers.
In some extreme instances, the team also identified and removed financial service apps involved in complex and malicious social engineering efforts designed to defraud users, including apps impersonating known services to facilitate phishing campaigns and that provided fraudulent financial and investment services. Through its ongoing work to review every app submission and investigate problematic apps on the App Store, App Review, in 2023, removed or rejected 40,000 apps from developers who engaged in bait-and-switch activity.
Malicious actors can also design apps with the intention to trick and scam users. In 2023, more than 248,000 app submissions were rejected from the App Store because they violated Apple’s policies against spam, blatantly copying other apps, or otherwise misleading users. This is in addition to over 38,000 app submissions that were rejected for containing hidden or undocumented features. Apps that are designed to access users’ private, personal data without their permission or knowledge are also prohibited from the App Store. Last year alone, over 375,000 app submissions were rejected for privacy violations.
App Review is diligent in investigating and taking action against apps reported as fraudulent or malicious through Apple’s Report a Problem tool. Fraudulent apps are immediately removed from the App Store, and the developer faces the risk of termination from the Apple Developer Program, which would also result in any unapproved apps under their account being blocked from the store. In 2023, App Review took action to prevent nearly 98,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users on the App Store.
Ratings and Reviews
Ratings and reviews are an essential resource for users looking for their next app and a valuable tool for developers to receive meaningful user feedback about their products. In 2023, with over 1.1 billion ratings and reviews processed, Apple removed nearly 152 million fraudulent ratings and reviews from the App Store.
Payment and Credit Card Fraud
From household goods to entertainment services, apps have become a mainstream way for users to make purchases. Apple is diligent in its efforts to protect users’ financial information through its secure payment technologies like Apple Pay and StoreKit, which nearly 1 million apps use to sell goods and services on the App Store. And as fraud losses globally reach new highs, Apple helped prevent more than $1.8 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions on its platform in 2023.
Apple takes credit card fraud extremely seriously and remains committed to protecting the App Store and its users. For example, when consumers make a purchase with Apple Pay, it uses a device-specific number and unique transaction code so a card number is never stored on a consumer’s device or on Apple servers. Additionally, credit and debit card numbers are never shared with developers, thus eliminating another risk factor in the payment transaction process.
When consumers use Apple Pay to make a purchase online or in-app, cards with certain enhanced fraud prevention will enable a consumer’s device to evaluate information — such as their Apple ID, device, and location if they have Location Services for Wallet turned on — in order to develop on-device fraud prevention assessments.
Apple also leverages a combination of advanced technology and human review to detect when a stolen credit card is being used for illicit purposes. In 2023 alone, Apple prevented more than 3.5 million stolen credit cards from being used to make fraudulent purchases and banned over 1.1 million accounts from transacting again.
Keeping the App Store Safe
Apple has dedicated an advanced suite of tools and resources to ensure the App Store is a safe and trusted place for users and developers. By thwarting the fraudulent efforts of bad actors, Apple ensures users can install software onto their personal devices knowing there are a number of safeguards in place to protect them, and developers have a reliable store with a strong reputation to distribute their apps and games.
Apple will continue to invest in its long-standing commitment to protect the quality and security of the App Store in the best interests of all users and developers.

2024-05-15,Increase,"Apple announces new accessibility features, including Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts","Text of this article
May 15, 2024
PRESS RELEASE
Apple announces new accessibility features, including Eye Tracking, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced new accessibility features coming later this year, including Eye Tracking, a way for users with physical disabilities to control iPad or iPhone with their eyes. Additionally, Music Haptics will offer a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music using the Taptic Engine in iPhone; Vocal Shortcuts will allow users to perform tasks by making a custom sound; Vehicle Motion Cues can help reduce motion sickness when using iPhone or iPad in a moving vehicle; and more accessibility features will come to visionOS. These features combine the power of Apple hardware and software, harnessing Apple silicon, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to further Apple’s decades-long commitment to designing products for everyone.
“We believe deeply in the transformative power of innovation to enrich lives,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “That’s why for nearly 40 years, Apple has championed inclusive design by embedding accessibility at the core of our hardware and software. We’re continuously pushing the boundaries of technology, and these new features reflect our long-standing commitment to delivering the best possible experience to all of our users.”
“Each year, we break new ground when it comes to accessibility,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These new features will make an impact in the lives of a wide range of users, providing new ways to communicate, control their devices, and move through the world.”
Eye Tracking Comes to iPad and iPhone
Powered by artificial intelligence, Eye Tracking gives users a built-in option for navigating iPad and iPhone with just their eyes. Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn’t shared with Apple.
Eye Tracking works across iPadOS and iOS apps, and doesn’t require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.
Music Haptics Makes Songs More Accessible
Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.
New Features for a Wide Range of Speech
With Vocal Shortcuts, iPhone and iPad users can assign custom utterances that Siri can understand to launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks. Listen for Atypical Speech, another new feature, gives users an option for enhancing speech recognition for a wider range of speech. Listen for Atypical Speech uses on-device machine learning to recognize user speech patterns. Designed for users with acquired or progressive conditions that affect speech, such as cerebral palsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or stroke, these features provide a new level of customization and control, building on features introduced in iOS 17 for users who are nonspeaking or at risk of losing their ability to speak.
“Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve speech recognition for millions of people with atypical speech, so we are thrilled that Apple is bringing these new accessibility features to consumers,” said Mark Hasegawa-Johnson, the Speech Accessibility Project at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s principal investigator. “The Speech Accessibility Project was designed as a broad-based, community-supported effort to help companies and universities make speech recognition more robust and effective, and Apple is among the accessibility advocates who made the Speech Accessibility Project possible.”
Vehicle Motion Cues Can Help Reduce Motion Sickness
Vehicle Motion Cues is a new experience for iPhone and iPad that can help reduce motion sickness for passengers in moving vehicles. Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle. With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.
CarPlay Gets Voice Control, More Accessibility Updates
Accessibility features coming to CarPlay include Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition. With Voice Control, users can navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice. With Sound Recognition, drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing can turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens. For users who are colorblind, Color Filters make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use, with additional visual accessibility features including Bold Text.
Accessibility Features Coming to visionOS
This year, accessibility features coming to visionOS will include systemwide Live Captions to help everyone — including users who are deaf or hard of hearing — follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps. With Live Captions for FaceTime in visionOS, more users can easily enjoy the unique experience of connecting and collaborating using their Persona. Apple Vision Pro will add the capability to move captions using the window bar during Apple Immersive Video, as well as support for additional Made for iPhone hearing devices and cochlear hearing processors. Updates for vision accessibility will include the addition of Reduce Transparency, Smart Invert, and Dim Flashing Lights for users who have low vision, or those who want to avoid bright lights and frequent flashing.
These features join the dozens of accessibility features already available in Apple Vision Pro, which offers a flexible input system and an intuitive interface designed with a wide range of users in mind. Features such as VoiceOver, Zoom, and Color Filters can also provide users who are blind or have low vision access to spatial computing, while features such as Guided Access can support users with cognitive disabilities. Users can control Vision Pro with any combination of their eyes, hands, or voice, with accessibility features including Switch Control, Sound Actions, and Dwell Control that can also help those with physical disabilities.
“Apple Vision Pro is without a doubt the most accessible technology I’ve ever used,” said Ryan Hudson-Peralta, a Detroit-based product designer, accessibility consultant, and cofounder of Equal Accessibility LLC. “As someone born without hands and unable to walk, I know the world was not designed with me in mind, so it’s been incredible to see that visionOS just works. It’s a testament to the power and importance of accessible and inclusive design.”

2024-05-21,Increase,Apple grantee Gravity Water prepares the next generation of water stewards in Vietnam,"Our philosophy is that rainwater has the ability to really shift the needle in water access for the people who need it most.
Danny Wright, Gravity Water’s founder

May 21, 2024
UPDATE
Apple grantee Gravity Water prepares the next generation of water stewards in Vietnam
With its innovative, climate-resilient rainwater harvesting and filtration technology, Gravity Water is providing over 38,000 students in Hòa Bình province with a clean water source
Snaking around Đà Bắc district in northern Vietnam’s rural Hòa Bình province, Hòa Bình Lake is still and tranquil. Families of farmers are sprinkled along its banks, coexisting with this expansive body of water. Their livelihoods depend on the resources it provides, including shrimp and freshwater fish, and when the natural streams coming off the mountains above are not enough — especially in the dry season — the lake’s water itself.
But in a place so beautiful with water seemingly so abundant, many locals have come to realize that the water is not safe. In some Dao families, an ethnic minority group that migrated to Vietnam as early as the 12th century, a belief is passed down from one generation to the next that a water deity — or a rain god — is only good to the people if they are good to the water.
“If we dirty the water, our water god will hit us in a negative way,” says Trần Thị Lan Hương, an administrator at the local Vay Nua Primary and Secondary Boarding School for Ethnic Minorities, where her son Màn Xuân Phûc attends second grade. “So we try to keep the water sources clean.”
In many instances, maintaining the quality of the water is out of the lakeside communities’ hands. Without proper filtration, groundwater retrieved from damaged wells is contaminated with calcium and other metals, while the streams running off the mountains are diverted or polluted in everyday agricultural practices — like irrigating rice fields and raising cattle — before they continue down the mountain. And in the dry seasons, the streams can slow to nothing more than a trickle.
At the school Hương’s son attends, global clean water organization Gravity Water has installed its innovative rainwater harvesting system to provide the teachers and students — many of whom live in the school’s dormitories from Monday to Saturday — a climate-resilient clean water source. In 2023, Apple awarded Gravity Water a grant to bring safe, clean water to 131 schools in northern Vietnam. This collaboration is connected with Apple’s water strategy to address water availability, water quality, and water accessibility in its supply chain around the world. Applying proven technologies to advance water access, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) in areas such as Hòa Bình province reflects the breadth of the efforts.
Using a human-centered design approach, Gravity Water partners with each school to determine their unique challenges and build the right solution for them. This approach allows the schools to have complete ownership by relying on the familiarity of their existing water storage system and the automation Gravity Water’s intervention provides.
“Weekly, we have five installations, and we get excited because we get to go to every school, and every school is different,” says Phan Viet Dung, Gravity Water’s project manager in Hòa Bình, who grew up in the province. “Transportation, the distance among the schools, and the conditions of the infrastructure are all so different. So at some schools, they lack tools, and in others, the water supply is unstable. We have to make sure that it doesn’t matter if the water source is stable or unstable — the school has clean water available all the time.”
Hòa Bình, which is classified as having a subtropic monsoon climate, experiences two distinct seasons. At the peak of the dry season, which typically lasts for one to two months between October and April, the province faces severe drought. The summer months bring heavy rains, some years totaling upward of 45 inches. As seen throughout the most densely populated parts of the world also situated in the subtropics, rainfall is both a necessity for nature and life to thrive, but also something to fear: Severe flooding and landslides are increasing in frequency in the most vulnerable communities, further polluting available water sources. But Gravity Water hopes to shift the perception of heavy rain as a climate threat, to one of its best solutions.
“Our philosophy is that rainwater has the ability to really shift the needle in water access for the people who need it most,” says Danny Wright, Gravity Water’s executive director, who founded the organization in 2016. “Rainwater harvesting is not new to Vietnam; it’s one of the world’s oldest technologies. I’ve gone to schools that have bamboo pieces cut in half collecting water off of roofs into different tanks. We have a huge opportunity to scale our technology and impact in these rural communities.”
By connecting a large weatherproof water tank to a series of smart meters to monitor levels of groundwater use and what’s collected from rainfall, Gravity Water is ensuring schools will have a reliable water source year-round. The system is fully automated, relying on the water level sensors to determine when to provide water — and from which source — to the school’s kitchens, bathrooms, and dormitories where the students shower and wash their clothes. The team is also training the school’s administration on how to monitor the school’s water consumption month to month. The teachers then take that monitoring a step further into their classrooms, modeling good water stewardship and hygiene practices in the students’ daily lessons and nonacademic activities.
“We have a lot of sessions to teach kids here how to use the water properly,” says Hà Thị Dự, Vay Nua’s vice principal. “Because they live here, they can learn that it takes time and effort to have clean water.”
“For us as students, each of us has to be responsible for our water supply,” says Bàn Thiên Anh, a seventh-grade student at Vay Nua. “This is the dry season, and we don’t have enough water from the source in the streams. At times, we don’t have enough water to clean the bathrooms, so we have to learn how to use water efficiently. For example, we only get water when we are thirsty, and we have to finish it. We should not waste it on the wrong purposes.”
At Hiền Lương Primary and Secondary School situated on the bank of Hòa Bình Lake, where another Gravity Water system has just been installed, Hà Hồng Liên leads a morning exercise routine during one of the students’ 15-minute breaks from lessons. As the school’s nurse, Liên is responsible for the children’s health and wellness.
“The children are happy all the time, and they have a lot of energy,” says Liên. “Every year, I have programs to teach children how to take care of themselves and how to maintain good hygiene. But there are a lot of students at break time, and they play and they are thirsty. Before Gravity Water, I was very concerned about my own health and the children here, regarding the quality of the water.”
“Even teachers have to use water carefully,” Liên continues. “If we use water to wash the vegetables, we will use that water to wash the dishes or do something else afterward. So we make sure that we can reuse water.”
“We are adults, so we are aware of the relationship between our safety, our health, and the environment,” says Phạm Thiên Nam, Hiền Lương’s principal. “We have a saying in Vietnamese that we eat cooked food and boiled water. We want the kids to learn the same thing, so that they not only have the knowledge but also can maintain their own safety.”
Whether at school or at home, access to drinking water can be costly in the communities across Hòa Bình, 70 percent of which are populated by ethnic minorities earning less than $4 USD per day who cannot afford bottled water or household filtration systems. Rainwater harvesting during the heavy monsoon season is one nature-based, cost-effective way to bridge the gap.
“We transform the disadvantage to an advantage, so we have more water to fill in Gravity Water’s tanks and the school’s tanks,” says Chu Thanh Hoa, Gravity Water’s national director in Vietnam.
Beyond Hòa Bình, Gravity Water has projects around the world to further scale its rainwater harvesting technology as a climate-resilient solution for schools and the most vulnerable communities. In Nepal, its systems are providing over 60 communities in the Kathmandu Valley with access to clean water. In Taipei, Taiwan, the organization is helping 48 schools and the city run its operations off rainwater. In Malaysia, Gravity Water’s technology is providing another 50 schools access to safe drinking water. And in Mexico, it is partnering with Isla Urbana, a local rainwater harvesting company that builds urban, rural, and school rain systems. With each of these projects, Gravity Water is collecting real-time data to measure impact and monitor the effectiveness of its system.
By 2030, Gravity Water plans to bring safe, clean water to 1 million structures through a variety of projects and partnerships at schools, with public infrastructure, and even in households. As severe weather events continue, and more populations are impacted in both developed and developing countries, the organization is optimistic about a future that keeps communities connected to their environment.
“Climate resilience is strengthening people’s relationship and understanding of their natural resources,” says Wright. “For the next generation of students and the people inheriting this planet, understanding the importance of saving water is so critical. We’re really excited to bring this education program to children to help them actually see their water use, see the rainwater harvesting, and get excited about it. And maybe that’s going to change behavior because while they’re washing their hands, they might say, ‘Hey, if I turn this faucet off, maybe that line tomorrow is going to be lower.’ And that’s what we’re really hoping to do: inspire critical thinking on how we can create solutions to help have a better relationship with our environment.”

Apple Music reveals top 10 albums of all time on 100 Best list
The Miseducation of Lauryn Hilltakes No. 1 spotSpecial guest artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rogers sit down with Apple Music’s Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden in a special countdown finale
Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums list culminates today with the much-anticipated reveal of the top 10 albums of all time andThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hillcrowned No. 1.
Upon receiving the news, Lauryn Hill told Apple Music, “This is my award, but it’s a rich, deep narrative, and involves so many people, and so much sacrifice, and so much time, and so much collective love.”
To celebrate, Apple Music’s Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden sat down with legendary record producer, writer, and performer Nile Rodgers and Grammy-nominated artist and producer Maggie Rogers to reflect on the list during a special roundtable broadcasting globally today on Apple Music. Watch the full roundtable atmusic.apple.com.
Apple Music’s100 Best Albumsis a modern 21st-century ranking of the greatest records ever made, crafted by Apple Music’s team of experts alongside a select group of artists, songwriters, producers, and industry professionals. The list is an editorial statement, fully independent of any streaming numbers on Apple Music — a love letter to the records that have shaped the world music lovers live and listen in.
Explore the top 10 albums below.
10.Lemonade(2016), Beyoncé
Beyoncé’s genre-obliterating blockbuster sixth album is furious, defiant, anguished, vulnerable, experimental, muscular, triumphant, humorous, and brave — a vivid personal statement, released without warning in a time of public scrutiny and private suffering. Every second ofLemonadedeserves to be studied and celebrated.
Nile Rodgers (NR):This album was so monumental. And I say this with a huge amount of respect because I know what it takes to achieve what she did here.
Zane Lowe (ZL):It was massive. Groundbreaking. It was the first time I feel that an artist of that magnitude, with that much attention on them, decided to take the narrative and really try to control it and share what they wanted to share.
Maggie Rogers (MR):I was in college when this record came out, and I remember hitting play on my laptop in my apartment, like my fifth-floor walkup in the East Village, and it was the first time I skipped class because I was halfway through and I was like, I’m not leaving. I have to be here today… What I hear more than anything is her power and the way it’s coupled with her vulnerability. There is such an exposition of female power on this record.
9.Nevermind(1991), Nirvana
Nevermindand its opening salvo “Smells Like Teen Spirit” didn’t just mark an unlikely breakthrough for the Seattle trio, it upended popular culture in ways never before and never since. Punk became pop, grunge became global vernacular, industry walls broke into rubble, and lead vocalist Kurt Cobain was anointed the reluctant voice of a generation in need of catharsis — all seemingly overnight.
ZL:When this album came out, it made everyone who heard it and connected to it feel like we finally had a band, a real band that was ours. And all the things we liked that seemed disconnected and seemed out of place and were not being taken seriously — it was like oh, you’re taking us seriously now.
MR:The vulnerability of this record, coupled with the intensity of the way it sounded and the cultural moment that it bled into, touched something.
Ebro Darden (ED):They wanted to be great. They wanted to write great songs. They wanted to give us all of the feels, right? It felt real.
8.Back to Black(2006), Amy Winehouse
Amy Winehouse’s presentation and otherworldly, timeless vocals make her music feel different — not so much an attempt to re-create the past as to honor the music she loved while still being true to the trash-talking, self-effacing millennial she was. The sound ofBack to Blackmight appeal to retro-soul fans and jazz classicists, but the attitude is closer to rap. Yes, she was funny. But she wasn’t kidding.
ZL:This is just heartbreak for 35 minutes. Unrequited, painful heartbreak made at times for the dance floor, at times to sing along to, at times to sway to — don’t let the joy of the music get it twisted. The songwriting is coming from a very painful place.
ED:Right from the beginning, I felt like her voice was delivered to us from another time. Like her vocal styling and what she was doing was timeless in a way.
MR:So many times when I hear an artist try and reference something in the past, I’m always like, I would kind of just rather have the original thing… But Amy Winehouse did it in a way that actually took all that tradition and then added something to it and moved it forward.
7.good kid, m.A.A.d city(2012), Kendrick Lamar
Kendrick Lamar’s sophomore albumgood kid, m.A.A.d cityis one of the defining hip-hop records of the 21st century. West Coast hip-hop elders like Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre anointed Lamar to carry on the legacy of gangsta rap, and the legacy of this album is a crucial example of American storytelling that established the future Pulitzer Prize winner as perhaps his generation’s most accomplished writer.
ZL:This is one of the most beautifully curated, created, structured, and track-listed albums of the modern era.
ED:Compton just had delivered so much hip-hop that there was a lot of pressure on this kid. The ability to deliver stories, bars, energy, performance on recorded material… He delivered on a Black consciousness that you don’t always get in hip-hop. And that’s why I’m really proud of the fact that it ranks where it does on this list.
6.Songs in the Key of Life(1976), Stevie Wonder
In 1974, Stevie Wonder was the most critically revered pop star in the world; he was also considering leaving the music industry altogether. So whenSongs in the Key of Lifewas released two years later, demand was so high that it became, at the time, the fastest-selling album in history. The album, which runs nearly 90 minutes, is effortlessly melodic, broad in scope, and deeply personal. Sonically, culturally, and emotionally,Songs in the Key of Lifeis much more than a gigantic collection of songs — it forms an entire worldview.
NR:For me, no matter what instrument he’s playing, he sort of speaks with the same voice. It’s a real unique gift. His singing, his harmonica playing, his keyboard playing all sounds like Stevie Wonder.
ZL:It’s iconic. He still continues to have such an enormous presence and influence on artists today, young and established.
MR:Songs in the Key of Lifejust exists as this unbelievable piece of art. I can’t imagine a world that doesn’t have this record in it.
5.Blonde(2016), Frank Ocean
ThoughBlondepacks 17 tracks into one quick hour, it’s a sprawling palette of ideas, a testament to the intelligence of flying one’s own artistic freak flag and trusting that audiences will meet them where they’re at. They did. And Ocean established himself as a generational artist uniquely suited to the complexities and convulsive changes of the second decade of the 21st century.
ZL:It is music put on canvas. I look at the canvas through different light at different times of the day, depending on how I feel. And I see strokes of color I never saw before or even knew existed. There’s so many layers and thoughts and emotions and hooks and ideas that all somehow make sense differently every single time.
MR:This record feels like smoke rising, it is so delicate and so unpredictable and so precise.
4.Purple Rain(1984), Prince & The Revolution
With half its track list comprising top 10 singles, this soundtrack is what truly turned Prince Rogers Nelson into one of the most instantly recognizable and distinctive pop artists ever. Prince often drew comparisons to Jimi Hendrix for the way he mixed music that felt Black and white, sacred and profane. The reality is that he had no precedent then and no comparison now.
ED:Prince is my favorite artist of all time. Without a doubt. You could point to everything that he does. He actually plays the instruments. He actually writes the song. He’s actually singing on stage. He’s actually doing his own art direction. He did his own fashion design. That was all him.
NR:When you think about artists who’ve had such a major impact on your life — my relationship with Prince was a very peculiar one because we were so regular, which is hard to say because he’s so irregular; he’s so abnormal. But the music, the film, just everything around this record was just so amazing. And it just put me in such a place of respect and happiness. And just like, man, not only you’re keeping the tradition alive, but you’re taking us to another level. I was just so proud to be in the world the same time he was in the world.
3.Abbey Road(1969), The Beatles
The Beatles’Abbey Roadis an ageless, unmatched collection of songs by a world-changing band at their creative peak. The band’s 11th and penultimate album sounds like nothing more or less than four extremely gifted humans playing one indelible song after another in the same room together.
MR:There is something so special about making music where you have a song that is describing some of the greatest human pain or sorrow next to a song that you would happily play for your 3-year-old, next to one of the greatest love songs… It’s timeless, but not just in the way that it will last forever, but in the way that there’s something for every moment of humanity and every human feeling on this record. It’s for people of every age.
NR:There’s something about the Beatles that’s always really magical to me. Believe it or not, the first song I ever actually learned to play on guitar was a Beatles song. I knew at that moment that I was going to be a guitar player. Prior to that, I played the clarinet.
ZL:The amount of songs that have stayed with people as they’ve lived their lives to a point… played at anniversaries, weddings, funerals, fall in love to, broken up to. There are lots of songbooks that speak to many times in life. I think The Beatles havethesongbook of life.
2.Thriller(1982), Michael Jackson
There are few pop albums, or even works of art, that denote a wholesale shift in time and space the way Michael Jackson’sThrillerdid in 1982. It did nothing less than define the modern pop blockbuster and redefine the scope and reach of music. Seven of its nine original cuts were top 10 singles, and it became one of the bestselling albums ever made.
ZL:Not only did it outsell everything in its opening year, it outsold everything in its second year. It changed the way people approached making music, releasing music, distributing, marketing music, and no one ever caught up to it. It set the bar so high.
NR:When Michael dropped this record, to me, the world changed. It was a seismic shift. Having a Black artist do a music video on the level of “Thriller” just changed the world.
1.The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill(1998), Lauryn Hill
Lauryn Hill’s debut — and only — solo studio album was a seismic event in 1998: a stunningly raw, profound look into the spiritual landscape not just of one of the era’s biggest stars, but of the era itself. She was, and remains, a once-in-a-generation talent whose inspiration and innovation can be heard through the decades. Artists exhaust long discographies hoping for a cohesive piece of work resonant enough to reshape culture and inscribe its creator into the pantheon; Lauryn Hill did it in one.
ZL:This album doesn’t just resonate with the people who were around when it came out and who hold it dear. It has not dated, not even a fraction. In fact, it feels more fresh and more relevant the more you listen to it… There are a lot of young artists hearing it, and it’s becoming part of their artistic DNA. It’s inspiring and influencing them… It’s timeless.
MR:Lauryn brought everybody with her on this record. She brought her community. She brought her friends and her family. You’re in the kitchen; you’re in the living room with her. You hear people; you hear the voices talking… It’s so open and so expansive and so direct… To have an artist like Lauryn Hill be the number one, that means a lot.
ED:It’s very personal. This album delivers on so many levels. It exemplifies and captures popular music of the last 25 years, holistically. It’s R&B, it’s hip-hop, it’s independent women, strong women, it’s topical, it’s sampling… I think that’s why it got voted number one.
NR:She’s amazing. This record is amazing.

May 28, 2024
UPDATE
Apple Hearing Study shares preliminary insights on tinnitus
Researchers from the University of Michigan release data from one of the largest surveys on tinnitus to date
The Apple Hearing Study is sharing new insights on tinnitus in one of the largest surveys to date.
Through the study, University of Michigan researchers reviewed a cohort of more than 160,000 participants who answered survey questions and completed app-based assessments to characterize their experience of tinnitus. This research aims to improve understanding of tinnitus characteristics and inform future research on potential treatments.
“Roughly 15 percent of our participants experience tinnitus daily,” said Rick Neitzel, University of Michigan School of Public Health’s professor of environmental health sciences. “Tinnitus is something that can have a large impact on a person’s life. The trends that we’re learning through the Apple Hearing Study about people’s experience with tinnitus can help us better understand the groups most at risk, which can in turn help guide efforts to reduce the impacts associated with it. The Apple Hearing Study gives us an opportunity that was not possible before to improve our understanding of tinnitus across demographics, aiding current scientific knowledge that can ultimately improve management of tinnitus.”
Tinnitus, or the perception of sound that others do not hear, can happen to many people in one or both ears. With tinnitus, the sounds can take many forms but are most commonly described as a ringing sound and can be momentary or occur over longer durations. The symptoms and experience of tinnitus can vary significantly from person to person and can change for an individual.
Tinnitus can impact a person’s overall quality of life, for example, disrupting a person’s sleep, concentration, or ability to hear clearly.
A first step toward advancing understanding of tinnitus is to learn more about who experiences it, how the experience differs between people and within an individual over time, the potential causes, and the methods for managing tinnitus and their perceived effectiveness.
Tinnitus Prevalence
The study found that 77.6 percent of participants have experienced tinnitus in their life, with the prevalence of daily tinnitus increasing with age among many. Those ages 55 and up were 3x more likely to hear tinnitus daily compared to those 18-34 years old. Additionally, 2.7 percent more male participants reported experiencing daily tinnitus compared to females. However, 4.8 percent more males stated they had never experienced tinnitus.
Management of Tinnitus
In the Apple Hearing Study, participants reported mainly trying three methods to ease their existing tinnitus: using noise machines (28 percent), listening to nature sounds (23.7 percent), and practicing meditation (12.2 percent). Less than 2.1 percent of participants chose cognitive and behavioral therapy to manage their tinnitus.
Cause of Tinnitus
While there’s no guaranteed method to prevent tinnitus given its complex causes, practicing hearing protection and managing stress levels can lower the chances of tinnitus. In the study, participants cited “noise trauma,” or exposure to excessively high levels of noise, as the primary cause of tinnitus (20.3 percent), followed closely by stress (7.7 percent).
Characterizing Tinnitus
The majority of participants experience brief episodes of tinnitus, compared to 14.7 percent who reported constant tinnitus. The reported duration of tinnitus significantly increases with age among participants 55 and older: 35.8 percent of participants ages 55 and older constantly experience tinnitus. Male participants experience constant tinnitus nearly 6.8 percent more than females.
As for tinnitus levels, the majority found it to be faint, with 34.4 percent calling it noticeable compared to 8.8 percent who found it very loud or ultra loud. Ten percent of participants reported that their tinnitus has moderately or entirely interfered with their ability to hear clearly.
In addition to the survey questions, participants who experienced tinnitus also completed an app-based sound test to better characterize their experience of tinnitus, matching the type and quality of the sounds they experience.
The majority of participants described their tinnitus as either a pure tone (78.5 percent) or white noise (17.4 percent). Among those who described a pure tone, 90.8 percent reported a pitch at 4 kilohertz or above, similar to the tones in a songbird’s call. Additionally, for those who described a pure tone, 83.5 percent identified their tinnitus as a single tone and 16.5 percent identified it as a teakettle tone — a high-pitched, whistling sound.
For participants who matched their tinnitus to a white noise, 57.7 percent identified it as a static tone, 21.7 percent compared it to a cricket tone, 11.2 percent said it was an electric tone, and 9.4 percent identified it as a pulse tone.
The Apple Hearing Study is one of three landmark public health studies in the Research app on iPhone, which launched in 2019 and is ongoing.
Conducted in collaboration with the University of Michigan, the Apple Hearing Study advances the understanding of sound exposure and its impact on hearing health. Researchers have already collected about 400 million hours of calculated environmental sound levels supplemented with lifestyle surveys to analyze how sound exposure affects hearing, stress, and hearing-related aspects of health. Study data will also be shared with the World Health Organization as a contribution to its Make Listening Safe initiative.
How Apple Products Can Help
Apple technology provides a number of features to support hearing health with just a tap.
Noise app: With the Noise app, Apple Watch users can enable notifications for when environmental noise levels might affect their hearing health. The Health app on iPhone keeps track of a user’s history of exposure to sound levels, and informs whether headphone audio levels or environmental sound levels have exceeded those recommended by World Health Organization standards.
Environmental sound reduction: Apple Watch users can see when the environmental sound level is reduced while they are wearing AirPods Pro and AirPods Max.
Active Noise Cancellation and Loud Sound Reduction mode: Active Noise Cancellation uses the microphone to detect external sounds, which AirPods Pro then counter with anti-noise, canceling the external sounds before a user hears them. For those looking to still enjoy surrounding sounds, Loud Sound Reduction with AirPods Pro (2nd generation) helps reduce loud noises while still keeping the fidelity of sound.
Reduce loud audio: To set a headphone volume limit, users can go into Settings, then tap Sounds & Haptics (on iPhone 7 and later) or Sounds (for earlier models). They’ll then tap Headphone Safety, where they can turn on Reduce Loud Audio and drag a slider to a preferred decibel level.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple empowers developers and fuels innovation with new tools and resources
Enhancements to Xcode and Swift, combined with new APIs, offer developers expanded capabilities for creating high‑quality apps
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today unveiled a suite of innovative new tools and resources designed to enable developers worldwide to create more powerful and efficient apps across all Apple platforms. With Xcode 16, developers can save time in their development process and get more done thanks to features like Swift Assist and predictive code completion. New and expanded APIs give developers the tools to advance their apps and introduce exciting features.
“At Apple, we are dedicated to providing developers everywhere with the cutting-edge technologies and resources to build incredible apps,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “With thoughtful innovation behind Xcode 16 and our latest platform APIs, we’ve created the best tools for developers to create outstanding apps. We’re excited to see what they build next.”
Xcode 16
Xcode 16 sets a new standard for developer productivity, offering features and performance enhancements that empower developers to build exceptional apps faster than ever before.
Swift Assist serves as a companion for all of a developer’s coding tasks, so they can focus on higher-level problems and solutions. It’s seamlessly integrated into Xcode, and knows the latest software development kits (SDKs) and Swift language features, so developers will always get the latest code features that blend perfectly into their projects. With Swift Assist, tasks like exploring new frameworks and experimenting with new ideas are just one request away. Swift Assist uses a powerful model that runs in the cloud — and like all Apple developer services, it is built with privacy and security in mind. Developers’ code is only used to process requests and never stored on servers, and Apple will not use it to train machine learning models.
The new predictive code completion engine in Xcode uses a unique model specifically trained for Swift and Apple SDKs, and can suggest the code developers need. Code completion is powered entirely by Apple silicon and machine learning enhancements inmacOS Sequoia, and runs locally on a developer’s device — meaning that code is kept completely private, and developers can receive relevant suggestions quickly even when working offline.
Xcode previews now offer a new dynamic linking architecture that uses the same build artifacts for previews and code execution, making for a smoother and more productive workflow when switching between the two.
Additional enhancements to testing environments in Xcode 16 make it easier than ever for developers to see how their apps perform in real-world conditions from the moment they begin building them. For example, developers can now localize and test their apps’ privacy policies, license agreements, and subscription group display name.
Swift 6
Swift 6 introduces new capabilities aimed at enhancing developer productivity and code clarity. As multicore architectures have made devices more powerful, Swift has continually added features to make concurrent programming easier. Swift 6 introduces compile-time data-race safety, which diagnoses concurrent access to memory across a developer’s project at compile time. This advancement allows errors to be caught and fixed with minimal changes to the entire codebase, enhancing code safety and maintainability for the future.
WWDC24 marks the 10th anniversary of Swift. Since its launch, Swift has empowered developers to create high-quality experiences across Apple’s ecosystem. Today, nearly 1 million apps use Swift, and it’s utilized throughout Apple’s software stack — from apps and frameworks, all the way down to firmware like Secure Enclave.
A decade in, Apple remains deeply committed to advancing Swift’s capabilities and fostering collaboration within the developer community. Apple is expanding the availability of Swift to a broader range of developers and programmers, with support for additional code editors that leverage the Language Server Protocol. Furthering its expansion, an all-new GitHub organization dedicated to Swift will host a number of critical projects for the Swift ecosystem — including the Swift compiler, Foundation, and other key libraries.
Swift Testing
The new Swift Testing framework offers developers expressive APIs that make it simple to write tests. It’s cross-platform and easy to learn, so developers can use it to write tests for a variety of platforms and domains. The framework also includes a flexible tagging system to help developers organize their tests and test plans. Swift Testing is designed for many of Swift’s use cases, from apps to servers.
Game Porting Toolkit 2
With the introduction of Game Porting Toolkit, developers have been able to bring their games to Apple devices faster than ever, and gaming enthusiasts can experience more games on Mac. Game Porting Toolkit 2 takes this to the next level with some of the most-requested capabilities from game developers, making it even easier to bring advanced games to Mac, as well as iPhone and iPad. Whether a developer is bringing an existing game or one that’s currently in development to Apple devices, Game Porting Toolkit 2 saves precious time. Thanks to improved compatibility with Windows games, powerful new shader debugging tools, and updates to Xcode that let developers unify their game code and shaders across devices, it’s never been easier to create amazing games across iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
visionOS 2
Apple Vision Pro continues to attract developers from all over the world who tap into its unique capabilities to create new spatial experiences — all powered by visionOS, the revolutionary spatial operating system that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world.visionOS 2introduces new APIs and frameworks, assisting developers with creating complex and nuanced spatial experiences that were never before possible.
New volumetric APIs give developers more control over how 3D objects appear in their apps, and allow even the most complex spatial apps to run side by side for the ultimate multitasking experience. TabletopKit makes it easy for developers to build spatial app experiences that anchor to flat surfaces, like manufacturing workstations or board and card games. RealityKit simplifies development for apps that support multiple Apple devices, decreasing development time and making workflows more efficient for Universal apps.
Developers can more easily create beautiful and immersive environments within their apps through new APIs, improved tooling, and a simplified development process. It’s also even easier to develop incredible spatial SharePlay experiences, and developers without Apple Vision Pro hardware can now create and preview SharePlay-based apps in Simulator. visionOS 2 also supports HealthKit, which allows apps to privately and securely access and share health data.
New enterprise APIs will help enterprises and business developers supercharge their workflows in healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and beyond.
Additional Platform APIs
Developers can adopt the new Controls API to let users accomplish even more tasks from even more places, such as to quickly unlock their vehicle or open their favorite third-party camera right from the Control Center.
AccessorySetupKit allows developers to seamlessly and securely pair Bluetooth accessories through their app without relying on access to all nearby Bluetooth accessories, keeping other devices private.
With updates to the Smart Stack on Apple Watch, developers will be able to use cues like time and date, location, wake up and bedtime, and more to make their apps show up as suggested widgets. And for the first time ever, apps that support Live Activities will automatically show up on Apple Watch.
Developers also now have access to a new watchOS double tap API so they can assign the gesture to key parts of their Apple Watch app experience.
TestFlight
TestFlight helps developers collect valuable beta feedback from testers to improve an app throughout the development and release process. With improvements to the TestFlight invitation and enrollment experience, developers will be able to engage testers by device and OS to receive higher-quality feedback for how to improve their apps.
TestFlight invitations will include the beta app’s description, app category, and optional screenshots to highlight new features and content for prospective testers. New metrics help developers evaluate engagement with public links and view invitation acceptances or declines.
App Store
For over 15 years, the App Store has made it easy for developers to distribute their apps and games to people all over the world and grow their businesses. This year, the App Store adds new ways for developers to get their apps discovered and new features for monetizing with subscriptions.
New featuring nominations let developers easily nominate their apps’ upcoming content and enhancements for consideration to be featured on the App Store. Developers can submit nominations in App Store Connect and include details such as publish date and relevant countries or regions. The expert App Store editorial team reviews each submission to help connect great apps and games with people who will love them.
Custom product pages enable developers to showcase different content and features that are available in their apps. Now, with custom product page deep links, developers can seamlessly direct people from a particular custom product page on the App Store to a relevant place within their apps. Deep links can also be used with Search Ads campaigns to provide a more consistent experience for users, from what they see in an ad to where they land in the app.
For subscription apps, developers can encourage former subscribers to resubscribe with new win-back offers. Eligible customers can discover these offers across the App Store as well as in their apps. For macOS apps, developers can provide discounted or free subscriptions for a period of time with offer codes to acquire, retain, and bring back former subscribers.
Enhancements to StoreKit views give developers new options to organize and present in-app purchases.
App Analytics has been expanded to help developers get even more insight into their business and their apps’ performance. Reports now include hundreds of new metrics that enable developers to find opportunities for improvement.
App Store Connect
The App Store Connect app for iOS and iPadOS features an updated user interface and introduces a new way for developers to promote their apps’ special moments. Whether they’re launching a brand-new app or shipping an exciting new app update, developers can now effortlessly generate marketing assets from App Store Connect to share directly onto their social channels. If an app has been featured as App of the Day, developers will receive a push notification from App Store Connect inviting them to create a special marketing asset to commemorate the moment.

PRESS RELEASE
watchOS 11 brings powerful health and fitness insights, and even more personalization and connectivity
Introducing the Vitals app, training load, new ways to tailor Activity rings, intelligent customization of the Smart Stack and Photos face, and the Translate app on Apple Watch
Cupertino, CaliforniaApple today previewedwatchOS 11, with features for Apple Watch that build on its leading sensor technology, advanced algorithms, and science-based approach to offer breakthrough insights into users’ health and fitness, and more personalization than ever. The new Vitals app surfaces key health metrics and context to help users make more informed day-to-day decisions, and the ability to measure training load offers a game-changing new experience when working out for improved fitness and performance. Activity rings are even more customizable, the Smart Stack and Photos face use intelligence to feature more individualization, and Apple Watch and the Health app on iPhone and iPad offer additional support for users who are pregnant. Check In, the Translate app, and new capabilities for the double tap gesture come to Apple Watch for added connectivity and convenience.
“watchOS is the world’s most advanced wearable operating system, supporting Apple Watch users throughout their day to stay healthy, active, and connected,” said David Clark, Apple’s senior director of watchOS Engineering. “This fall, watchOS 11 makes Apple Watch an even more essential companion by offering users additional actionable insights into their health and fitness, more personalization to fit their unique needs, and new ways to stay connected while on the go.”
The Vitals App Surfaces Greater Insights into Key Health Metrics
Apple Watch allows users to measure important health metrics during sleep: heart rate, respiratory rate, wrist temperature, sleep duration, and blood oxygen. With watchOS 11, the new Vitals app gives users a way to quickly view these key health metrics and gain better context when it comes to their health. Apple Watch analyzes these metrics so users can now check in on their daily health status and explore noteworthy metrics at a glance, and easily see when they are out of a user’s typical range. When two or more metrics are out of their typical range, users can receive a notification, along with a message detailing how the changes in these specific metrics may be linked to other aspects of their life, such as elevation changes, alcohol consumption, or even illness.
Apple’s health features are grounded in science and developed with input from clinical experts. To inform out-of-range classifications and notifications, Vitals uses an algorithm developed using real-world data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study, research that aims to advance the understanding of heart health and physical activity.
Additional Support During Pregnancy
watchOS 11, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18 offer additional support for pregnant users to reflect changes in their physical and mental health during this important time. When users log a pregnancy in the Health app on iPhone or iPad, the Cycle Tracking app on Apple Watch will show their gestational age and allow them to log symptoms for things frequently experienced during pregnancy. They will also be prompted to review things like their high heart rate notification threshold, since heart rate tends to increase during pregnancy.
In the Health app on iPhone or iPad, pregnant users can also choose to be reminded to take a mental health assessment on a monthly basis, as people can be at a higher risk for conditions like depression during and after pregnancy. Walking Steadiness, measured by iPhone, can also alert users more quickly of potential fall risk during the third trimester of pregnancy, since the risk often increases during that stage.
A Powerful New Understanding of Training Load
watchOS 11 introduces training load, an insightful new way to measure how the intensity and duration of workouts is impacting a user’s body over time. Training load helps users understand the strain on their body from workouts over the last seven days compared to the last 28 days. These insights can help users make informed decisions about their training each day, particularly when preparing for an event — whether it is their first 5K, a bike race, or a marathon.
To measure intensity, a new effort rating will be available after each workout to track how difficult it was on a scale from 1 to 10. Popular cardio-based workout types will employ an innovative new algorithm to automatically generate an estimated effort rating, using a combination of data sources like age, height, and weight, alongside workout data like GPS, heart rate, and elevation. Users can also manually adjust this estimate to take into account other factors such as stress or soreness. For workouts where an automatic estimate is not provided — like strength training — users can still enter an effort rating at the end of each workout.
Apple Watch will establish a 28-day training load, a weighted average taking into account both the effort ratings and duration of users’ workouts over this period. In the Activity app, users can see how their training load for the most recent seven days compares to their 28-day training load, classified as well below, below, steady, above, or well above. This helps indicate if the current strain on their body is ramping up, staying the same, or easing off so they can adjust their training for the best results. Additional information in the Fitness app on iPhone further details the possible impact on their fitness if they continue to train at that current level, like potential changes in fitness or risk of injury.
A user’s daily health status and ability to train can be intertwined, so training load can be viewed alongside information from the Vitals app in the Activity app on Apple Watch or the Fitness app on iPhone. Users can also view their training load within the Vitals app.
More Customizable Activity Rings and Fitness App
Every day, Activity rings keep Apple Watch users motivated to sit less, move more, and get some exercise — and with watchOS 11, they’re even more customizable. Whether users are planning a rest day during their training, have an injury, or just need a day off, they now have the ability to pause their rings for a day, week, month, or more — without affecting their award streaks. Users can also customize their Activity ring goals by the day of the week, so the rings provide the right amount of motivation at the right moments.
Additionally, the Fitness app on iPhone offers users the ability to customize the Summary tab to see exactly what they want to see, including new metrics for workouts like running, hiking, swimming, and mindfulness.
Apple Fitness+ has been redesigned in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and tvOS 18 to help users make the most of its robust library, stay motivated, and keep consistent with their fitness routine. Updates include a personalized For You space, Explore and Library spaces, search features, and enhanced awards.
The Smart Stack and Photos Face Add Personalization
Apple Watch offers a variety of ways for users to customize their experience, and updates in watchOS 11 make Apple Watch more personalized and convenient than ever.
The Smart Stack is designed to help users quickly access important information from any watch face, and in watchOS 11, it is even more intelligent. New widgets including Shazam, Photos, Distance, and more are now available. Additionally, the Smart Stack can suggest widgets based on time, date, location, daily routines, and more so it is even simpler to access features on Apple Watch when a user needs them. For example, the new severe weather alerts widget can appear before a thunderstorm. New interactive widgets allow users to interact with an app directly from the Smart Stack, and Live Activities is also now available on Apple Watch within the Smart Stack.
In watchOS 11, the Photos watch face can help a user select their best photo options by quickly analyzing thousands of photos using machine learning and making recommendations based on aesthetics, composition, and even facial expressions. Then, a custom algorithm finds the best composition by optimizing for the subject’s position within the frame and creating a sense of depth. Users can further personalize the face with time sizes, layouts, font choices, and more, and the Photos face now offers Dynamic mode so users can be delighted by a new image every time they raise their wrist.
Even More Convenience and Ways to Stay Connected
To help users feel even more connected and safe, Check In is now available on Apple Watch, including during workouts. Whether users are heading out on an early morning run or to a late-night gym session, they can access Check In directly within the Workout app so a friend or family member can keep an eye out for their workout to end. Users can also start a Check In from Messages, like they can on iPhone.
The Translate app also comes to Apple Watch, so users can access translation for one of 20 supported languages directly on their wrist. With the new intelligence of the Smart Stack, Apple Watch can automatically offer a suggested Translate app widget when users are traveling to a location with a language that is different from their Apple Watch. And Translate now provides romanization, the pronunciation for languages using the Latin alphabet.
Additionally, the double tap gesture can now be used to scroll through any app — like Messages, Calendar, or Weather — making it even easier to interact with Apple Watch with one hand.
Additional updates in watchOS 11 include:
New Tools for Developers
watchOS 11 includes new APIs that allow developers to take advantage of the increased intelligence and capabilities of the Smart Stack, and the magical experience of the double tap gesture.
Developers can incorporate relevancy cues like time and date to have important information from their app appear at just the right time in the Smart Stack, and can now add capabilities like interactivity to their widgets. Live Activities will automatically show up in the Smart Stack, so users can see updates in the moment, like when an order is ready at Panera Bread or a flight’s gate has changed with Flighty. Developers can use an API to customize how a Live Activity surfaces on Apple Watch.
Additionally, the new Double Tap API allows developers to define actions within apps that users can complete with just one hand, such as logging their baby’s time asleep on Sprout’s Baby Tracker app.
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.
Availability
The developer beta of watchOS 11 is available to Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today. A public beta will be available to watchOS users next month atbeta.apple.com. watchOS 11 will be available this fall as a free software update for Apple Watch Series 6 or later paired with iPhone Xs or later, running iOS 18. Some features may not be available in all regions or all languages, or on all devices. Features are subject to change. For more information, visitapple.com/watchos/watchos-preview.

June 10, 2024
PRESS RELEASE
visionOS 2 brings new spatial computing experiences to Apple Vision Pro
Powerful new capabilities come to Apple Vision Pro just months after its U.S. release, including a new way to turn favorite photos into spatial photos, new gestures for navigating visionOS, and more ways for developers to take advantage of spatial computing
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewedvisionOS 2, a major update to Apple Vision Pro that introduces a powerful way for users to create spatial photos with the images already in their library, intuitive hand gestures to easily access important information at a glance, and new features for Mac Virtual Display, Travel Mode, and Guest User. Vision Pro users can quickly and easily find their favorite spatial photos in the redesigned Photos app, manage information across all of their accounts with the new Passwords app, access new privacy tools in Safari, and experience new capabilities in popular apps, including Apple TV and Mindfulness.
With more than 2,000 spatial apps designed for Apple Vision Pro, and more than 1.5 million compatible iOS and iPadOS apps, visionOS 2 enables developers to take further advantage of spatial computing with new tools, and makes it easier to create all-new app experiences that are more volumetric and shareable.
“Apple Vision Pro delivers revolutionary experiences for users and developers, and we’re excited to advance spatial computing even further with visionOS 2 just months after its initial release,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Vision Products Group. “From navigating visionOS more seamlessly to pushing the boundaries of how users connect with memories, and enhancements to key Vision Pro apps, we can’t wait for users to experience the range of new capabilities with visionOS 2. And with a robust set of tools that enable developers to create richer spatial apps, visionOS 2 makes Vision Pro even more powerful.”
Create and Relive Stunning Spatial Memories in All‑New Ways
Spatial photos on Apple Vision Pro bring incredible depth and realism to favorite moments with family and friends. With visionOS 2, users can revisit past memories by creating spatial photos directly from their library in the Photos app. visionOS uses advanced machine learning to transform a 2D image into a beautiful spatial photo that truly comes to life on Vision Pro. Users can share their spatial photos with loved ones to view on Vision Pro, or use SharePlay in the Photos app with their spatial Persona and enjoy their panoramas, spatial videos, and more — all while feeling like everyone is in the same physical space.
Capturing spatial videos on Apple Vision Pro and iPhone 15 Pro allows users to bring special moments to life and relive them as though they are back in the moment. Later this year, Canon will offer a brand-new spatial lens for its popular EOS R7 digital camera to capture gorgeous spatial video, even in challenging lighting conditions. An update to Final Cut Pro will enable creators to edit spatial videos on their Mac and add immersive titles and effects to their projects, and with the Vimeo app designed for Vision Pro, users will be able to upload and share spatial videos for others to discover and enjoy.
New Hand Gestures and Productivity Features Bring More Capabilities to visionOS
visionOS introduced a revolutionary spatial interface that users control with just their eyes, hands, and voice. visionOS 2 makes navigating Apple Vision Pro faster and easier for users to access key functions with new hand gestures to get to frequently used features like Home View and Control Center. New gestures allow users to see important information at a glance, like the current time and battery level, and perform actions like adjusting the volume.
Apple Vision Pro productivity tools get new capabilities with visionOS 2. Later this year, Mac Virtual Display will feature a higher resolution and larger size — creating an ultra-wide display that is equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. To create the perfect workspace, visionOS 2 also adds mouse support for additional workflow options, and Vision Pro will now reveal the user’s physical Magic Keyboard — even when they are fully immersed in an Environment or app.
Key Apple Vision Pro experiences have been enhanced in visionOS 2. Users can now personalize their Home View by rearranging apps and placing them wherever they want, including their compatible iPhone and iPad apps. Travel Mode adds support for trains, so travelers can experience their favorite apps on the go and even dial in an Environment like Bora Bora to transform their physical surroundings. For those moments when a user wants to share their Vision Pro, a family member or colleague can be added as a Guest User and have their eye and hand data saved for 30 days.
Powerful Tools Unlock Exciting Ways for Developers and Creators to Build Innovative New Experiences
Developers have already built amazing app experiences for Apple Vision Pro that take advantage of the unique capabilities of spatial computing across a wide array of categories. visionOS 2 includes new APIs and frameworks that help developers take their apps even further by making it easier to create apps and games that are more volumetric and introduce new shareable experiences. HealthKit also comes to Vision Pro, giving developers new ways to create innovative health and fitness experiences that take advantage of the infinite canvas in visionOS.
1640 LLC, developer of the app The Museum That Never Was, is using new volumetric APIs in visionOS 2 to make it easier to add more immersive 3D objects to its app and new ways for users to interact with their content. New tools like TabletopKit enable developers to quickly build shared and collaborative app experiences centered around a table, like board games or a manufacturing workstation. GRL Games is using TabletopKit to create Haunted Chess, a murder mystery board game where players use 3D chess pieces and holographic cards to help solve the mystery. These apps work great with spatial Persona for shared experiences never before possible.
Enterprise developers are already building world-class visionOS apps for everything from training and simulation to project design and management. New tools in visionOS 2 enable developers to extend capabilities in the healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, and other industries. Developers including Scandit AG and TeamViewer are using new APIs like Barcode Scanning and Object Tracking to help organizations further improve day-to-day operations.
Apple Immersive Video is a storytelling format that leverages 3D 8K video with a 180-degree field of view and Spatial Audio to transport viewers to the center of the action. The Apple TV app is home to a growing slate of Apple Immersive films and series, includingAdventurefrom Apple TV+ andAlicia Keys: Rehearsal Room. Later this year, Blackmagic Design will launch the first-ever commercially available camera system, and an update to its post-production software DaVinci Resolve Studio, to support Apple Immersive Video, giving professional filmmakers around the world tools to create remarkable stories with this ultra-immersive storytelling format.
Additional features in visionOS 2 include:

2024-06-10,Decrease,"Introducing Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac","Text of this article
June 10, 2024
PRESS RELEASE
Introducing Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac
Setting a new standard for privacy in AI, Apple Intelligence understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducedApple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers.
“We’re thrilled to introduce a new chapter in Apple innovation. Apple Intelligence will transform what users can do with our products — and what our products can do for our users,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Our unique approach combines generative AI with a user’s personal context to deliver truly helpful intelligence. And it can access that information in a completely private and secure way to help users do the things that matter most to them. This is AI as only Apple can deliver it, and we can’t wait for users to experience what it can do.”
New Capabilities for Understanding and Creating Language
Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
Whether tidying up class notes, ensuring a blog post reads just right, or making sure an email is perfectly crafted, Writing Tools help users feel more confident in their writing. With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, adjusting the tone to suit the audience and task at hand. From finessing a cover letter, to adding humor and creativity to a party invitation, Rewrite helps deliver the right words to meet the occasion. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits — along with explanations of the edits — that users can review or quickly accept. With Summarize, users can select text and have it recapped in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.
In Mail, staying on top of emails has never been easier. With Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day dinner invitation or boarding pass. Across a user’s inbox, instead of previewing the first few lines of each email, they can see summaries without needing to open a message. For long threads, users can view pertinent details with just a tap. Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response, and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.
Deep understanding of language also extends to Notifications. Priority Notifications appear at the top of the stack to surface what’s most important, and summaries help users scan long or stacked notifications to show key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. And to help users stay present in what they’re doing, Reduce Interruptions is a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention, like a text about an early pickup from daycare.
In the Notes and Phone apps, users can now record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help recall key points.
Image Playground Makes Communication and Self‑Expression Even More Fun
Apple Intelligence powers exciting image creation capabilities to help users communicate and express themselves in new ways. With Image Playground, users can create fun images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use and built right into apps including Messages. It’s also available in a dedicated app, perfect for experimenting with different concepts and styles. All images are created on device, giving users the freedom to experiment with as many images as they want.
With Image Playground, users can choose from a range of concepts from categories like themes, costumes, accessories, and places; type a description to define an image; choose someone from their personal photo library to include in their image; and pick their favorite style.
With the Image Playground experience in Messages, users can quickly create fun images for their friends, and even see personalized suggested concepts related to their conversations. For example, if a user is messaging a group about going hiking, they’ll see suggested concepts related to their friends, their destination, and their activity, making image creation even faster and more relevant.
In Notes, users can access Image Playground through the new Image Wand in the Apple Pencil tool palette, making notes more visually engaging. Rough sketches can be turned into delightful images, and users can even select empty space to create an image using context from the surrounding area. Image Playground is also available in apps like Keynote, Freeform, and Pages, as well as in third-party apps that adopt the new Image Playground API.
Genmoji Creation to Fit Any Moment
Taking emoji to an entirely new level, users can create an original Genmoji to express themselves. By simply typing a description, their Genmoji appears, along with additional options. Users can even create Genmoji of friends and family based on their photos. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback.
New Features in Photos Give Users More Control
Searching for photos and videos becomes even more convenient with Apple Intelligence. Natural language can be used to search for specific photos, such as “Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,” or “Katie with stickers on her face.” Search in videos also becomes more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips so users can go right to the relevant segment. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.
With Memories, users can create the story they want to see by simply typing a description. Using language and image understanding, Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. Users will even get song suggestions to match their memory from Apple Music. As with all Apple Intelligence features, user photos and videos are kept private on device and are not shared with Apple or anyone else.
Siri Enters a New Era
Powered by Apple Intelligence, Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri is more natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal, with the ability to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. It can follow along if users stumble over words and maintain context from one request to the next. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment. Siri also has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when Siri is active.
Siri can now give users device support everywhere they go, and answer thousands of questions about how to do something on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Users can learn everything from how to schedule an email in the Mail app, to how to switch from Light to Dark Mode.
With onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users’ content in more apps over time. For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, “Add this address to his contact card.”
With Apple Intelligence, Siri will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. For example, a user could say, “Bring up that article about cicadas from my Reading List,” or “Send the photos from the barbecue on Saturday to Malia,” and Siri will take care of it.
Siri will be able to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to the user and their on-device information. For example, a user can say, “Play that podcast that Jamie recommended,” and Siri will locate and play the episode, without the user having to remember whether it was mentioned in a text or an email. Or they could ask, “When is Mom’s flight landing?” and Siri will find the flight details and cross-reference them with real-time flight tracking to give an arrival time.
A New Standard for Privacy in AI
To be truly helpful, Apple Intelligence relies on understanding deep personal context while also protecting user privacy. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence.
With Private Cloud Compute, Apple Intelligence can flex and scale its computational capacity and draw on larger, server-based models for more complex requests. These models run on servers powered by Apple silicon, providing a foundation that allows Apple to ensure that data is never retained or exposed.
Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to verify privacy, and Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures that iPhone, iPad, and Mac do not talk to a server unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection. Apple Intelligence with Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in AI, unlocking intelligence users can trust.
ChatGPT Gets Integrated Across Apple Platforms
Apple is integrating ChatGPT access into experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between tools.
Siri can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise when helpful. Users are asked before any questions are sent to ChatGPT, along with any documents or photos, and Siri then presents the answer directly.
Additionally, ChatGPT will be available in Apple’s systemwide Writing Tools, which help users generate content for anything they are writing about. With Compose, users can also access ChatGPT image tools to generate images in a wide variety of styles to complement what they are writing.
Privacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT — their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won’t store requests. ChatGPT’s data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.
ChatGPT will come to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia later this year, powered by GPT-4o. Users can access it for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT subscribers can connect their accounts and access paid features right from these experiences.
Availability
Apple Intelligence is free for users, and will be available in beta as part ofiOS 18,iPadOS 18, andmacOS Sequoiathis fall in U.S. English. Some features, software platforms, and additional languages will come over the course of the next year. Apple Intelligence will be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with Siri and device language set to U.S. English.

PRESS RELEASE
iOS 18 makes iPhone more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever
The release introduces all-new customization options, the biggest-ever redesign of Photos, powerful updates for staying connected, and Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewediOS 18, a major release that features more customization options, the biggest redesign ever of the Photos app, new ways for users to manage their inbox in Mail, Messages over satellite, and so much more. Users will be able to arrange apps and widgets in any open space on the Home Screen, customize the buttons at the bottom of the Lock Screen, and quickly access more controls in Control Center. Photo libraries are automatically organized in a new single view in Photos, and helpful new collections keep favorites easily accessible. Mail simplifies the inbox by sorting email into categories using on-device intelligence, and all-new text effects come to iMessage. Powered by the same groundbreaking technology as existing iPhone satellite capabilities, users can now communicate over satellite in the Messages app when a cellular or Wi-Fi connection isn’t available.1
iOS 18 also introducesApple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant.2Built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context, to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks.
“We are thrilled to introduce iOS 18. It is a huge release with incredible features, including new levels of customization and capability, a redesigned Photos app, and powerful ways to stay connected with Messages. There are so many benefits for everyone,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “This release also marks the beginning of a tremendously exciting new era of personal intelligence with Apple Intelligence delivering intuitive, powerful, and instantly useful experiences that will transform the iPhone experience, all with privacy at the core. We can’t wait for users to experience it.”
New Levels of Customization and Capability
iPhone users have new ways to customize the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center. Users can now arrange apps and widgets in any open space on the Home Screen, including placing them right above the dock for easy access or perfectly framing a wallpaper. App icons and widgets can take on a new look with a dark or tinted effect, and users can make them appear larger to create the experience that is perfect for them.
Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, and it gets new levels of customization and flexibility. The redesign delivers quick access to new groups of a user’s most-utilized controls, such as media playback, Home controls, and connectivity, as well as the ability to easily swipe between each. Users can now add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center to quickly unlock a vehicle or jump right into capturing content for social media — all from one place. The new controls gallery displays the full set of available options, and users can customize how the controls are laid out, including adjusting them to the ideal size and creating entirely new groups.
For the first time, users can now switch the controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen, including choosing from options available in the controls gallery or removing them entirely. With the Action button available on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, users can quickly invoke controls available in the gallery.
Photos Gets a Unified View, New Collections, and Customization
Photos receives its biggest-ever redesign to help users easily find and relive special moments. A simplified, single view displays a familiar grid, and new collections help users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. Plus, collections can be pinned to keep favorites easily accessible. A new carousel view presents highlights that update each day and feature favorite people, pets, places, and more. Autoplaying content throughout the app brings libraries to life, so past moments can be enjoyed while browsing. Because each user’s photo library is unique, the app is customizable, so users can organize collections, pin collections to access frequently, and include what’s most important to them in the carousel view.
Powerful Ways to Stay Connected in Messages
iMessage receives all-new text effects that bring conversations to life by amplifying any letter, word, phrase, or emoji with dynamic, animated appearances. Users can better express tone by adding formatting like bold, underline, italics, and strikethrough. Tapbacks expand to include any emoji or sticker, and now users can compose a message and schedule to send it at a later time.
When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS.
iOS 18 introduces Messages via satellite for the times when cellular and Wi-Fi connections aren’t available. Powered by the same groundbreaking technology as existing iPhone satellite capabilities, Messages via satellite automatically prompts users to connect to their nearest satellite right from the Messages app to send and receive texts, emoji, and Tapbacks over iMessage and SMS.3With Dynamic Island, users always know when they are connected to a satellite. Because iMessage was built to protect user privacy, iMessages sent via satellite are end-to-end encrypted.
Enhancements to Mail
Later this year, Mail will introduce new ways for users to manage their inbox and stay up to date. On-device categorization organizes and sorts incoming email into Primary for personal and time-sensitive emails, Transactions for confirmations and receipts, Updates for news and social notifications, and Promotions for marketing emails and coupons. Mail also features a new digest view that pulls together all of the relevant emails from a business, allowing users to quickly scan for what’s important in the moment.
Big Updates to Safari
Safari, the world’s fastest browser,4now offers an even easier way to discover information on the web with Highlights and a redesigned Reader experience. Using machine learning, Safari can surface key information about a webpage. For example, users can review a summary to get the gist of an article; quickly see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark; or listen to an artist’s track right from an article about the song or album. Reader has been redesigned to offer even more ways to enjoy articles without distraction, with a summary and table of contents included for longer articles.
Introducing the Passwords App
Building on the foundation of Keychain, which was first introduced more than 25 years ago, the new Passwords app makes it easy for users to access their passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes. The app also includes alerts for users regarding common weaknesses, such as passwords that are easily guessed or used multiple times and those that appear in known data leaks.
New Privacy Features Designed to Empower Users
iOS 18 gives users even more control with tools to manage who can see their apps, how contacts are shared, and how their iPhone connects to accessories.
Locked and hidden apps offer users peace of mind that information they want to keep private, such as app notifications and content, will not inadvertently be seen by others. Users can now lock an app; and for additional privacy, they can hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system.
iOS 18 puts users in control by letting them choose to share only specific contacts with an app. In addition, developers now have a way to seamlessly connect third-party accessories with iPhone without letting an app see all the other devices on a user’s network, keeping a user’s devices private and making pairing seamless.
Apple Intelligence Transforms the iPhone Experience
Deeply integrated into iOS 18 and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
New image capabilities make communication and self-expression even more fun. With Image Playground, users can create playful images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use, built right into apps like Messages, and also available in a dedicated app.
Memories in Photos lets users create the stories they want to see just by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. In addition, a new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.
With the power of Apple Intelligence, Siri takes a major step forward, becoming even more natural, contextually relevant, and personal. Users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment.
With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing, and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers. When requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple and is only used to fulfill the user’s requests, and independent experts can verify this privacy.
Additionally, access to ChatGPT is integrated into Siri and systemwide Writing Tools across Apple’s platforms, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between tools.

PRESS RELEASE
iPadOS 18 introduces powerful new intelligence features and apps designed for Apple Pencil
iPadOS 18 takes iPad to the next level with Apple Intelligence, the introduction of Calculator with Math Notes, new handwriting tools in Notes, additional ways to customize iPad, and more
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today previewediPadOS 18, a major release that enhances the iPad experience, making it more versatile and intelligent than ever. With iPadOS 18, Calculator comes to iPad with Math Notes, along with new handwriting tools in Notes — all designed for Apple Pencil. iPad users now have more ways to customize the Home Screen and Control Center, and with iPadOS 18, users receive the biggest redesign of the Photos app to date and new ways to express themselves in Messages.
iPadOS 18 also introducesApple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that’s incredibly useful and relevant. Built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iPadOS 18, iOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. It understands and creates language and images, takes action across apps, and draws from personal context, simplifying and accelerating everyday tasks. Taking full advantage of the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine, Apple Intelligence will be supported on iPad models with an M-series chip.1
“Our most versatile device is becoming even more powerful and intelligent than ever with iPadOS 18,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering.“With fun new ways to personalize the Home Screen, a redesigned Photos experience, major updates to the Notes app, the addition of Calculator with Math Notes, and the groundbreaking introduction of Apple Intelligence, iPadOS 18 brings incredible new features designed for the unique capabilities of iPad, making it even easier for users to get tasks done.”
Calculator on iPad Delivers a New Way to Solve with Math Notes
An all-new Math Notes calculator allows users to type or write out mathematical expressions and see them instantly solved in their own handwriting. They can also assign values to variables when learning new concepts in class, calculating a budget, and more. With a new graphing feature, users can write or type an equation and insert a graph with just one tap, and can even add multiple equations on the same graph to see how they relate. And Math Notes are automatically accessible in the Notes app in the new Math Notes folder.
The basic and scientific calculators on iPad make it easy to view complete expressions before completing them. History helps users keep track of previous calculations, and unit conversions let users quickly convert length, weight, currencies, and more.
More Flexible Handwritten Notes with Smart Script
With the power of Apple Pencil, Smart Script makes handwritten notes fluid, flexible, and easier to read, all while maintaining the look and feel of a user’s personal handwriting. Smart Script allows users to write quickly without sacrificing legibility by smoothing and straightening handwritten text in real time. And it makes editing handwritten text just as simple as editing typed text. With Apple Pencil, users can easily add space, scratch out a sentence, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting, and the paragraph will automatically reflow to fit the new content.
The Notes app brings enhancements to typed text, too. For added convenience, users can now organize the content of their notes by collapsing sections under headings or subheadings. And for information that needs to stand out, they can choose from five new text highlight colors.
More Ways to Customize iPad
iPadOS 18 introduces even more options for users to express themselves, including brand-new ways to customize the Home Screen and app icons as well as Control Center. App icons and widgets can be placed in any open position on the Home Screen to create the ideal layout and let a user’s wallpaper shine through. They can be customized to appear exactly how users want — light, dark, or with a tint. Users can also make all the app icons and widgets appear even larger, removing the name underneath, for a new streamlined look.
Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, and it gets new levels of customization and flexibility. The redesign delivers quick access to new groups of a user’s most-utilized controls, such as media playback, Home controls, and connectivity, as well as the ability to easily swipe between each. Users can now add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center all from one place. Developers can take advantage of the new Controls API to let their users accomplish even more tasks, like quickly unlocking a vehicle or instantly capturing content for social media.
A New Tab Bar Brings Easier Navigation
A redesigned tab bar floats above app content and complements the sidebar to help users stay focused on what matters most while keeping favorite tabs within reach. The new floating tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar so users can dive deeper into an app’s full functionality. With the redesigned tab bar, iPad users can reorder or add other tabs from the sidebar, unlocking an entirely new way to customize in-app experiences.
A Redesigned Photos App to Relive Special Moments
The Photos app receives its biggest redesign yet — which takes advantage of the larger display on iPad — automatically keeping libraries organized so users can spend less time searching and more time enjoying their best moments. A simplified, single view displays a familiar grid, and new collections help users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. Plus, collections can be pinned to keep favorites easily accessible. A new carousel view presents highlights that update each day and feature favorite people, pets, places, and more. Autoplaying content throughout the app brings libraries to life, so past moments can be enjoyed while browsing. Because each user’s photo library is unique, the app is customizable, so users can organize collections, pin collections to access frequently, and include what’s most important to them in the carousel view.
New Ways to Stay Connected in Messages
Messages receives big updates to the ways users express themselves and stay connected. Text formatting like bold, underline, italics, and all-new animated text effects bring iMessage conversations to life, and with redesigned Tapbacks, users can react to a message with any emoji or sticker. Messages in iPadOS 18 introduces the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time, helping users stay fully in control of when and how they are connecting with their closest contacts.
Safari Enables Distraction-Free Browsing
Safari, the world’s fastest browser,2now offers an even easier way to discover information on the web with Highlights and a redesigned Reader experience. Using machine learning, Safari can surface key information about a webpage. For example, users can review a summary to get the gist of an article; quickly see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark; or listen to an artist’s track right from an article about the song or album. Additionally, with a redesigned Reader view, there are even more ways to enjoy a streamlined presentation of an article and its summary.
New Privacy Controls
iPadOS 18 gives users even more ways to control who can see their apps, how they share their contacts, and how their iPad connects to accessories. Locked and hidden apps offer users peace of mind that information they want to keep private, such as app notifications and content, will not inadvertently be seen by others. Users can now lock an app; and for additional privacy, they can hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system.
Users also have more control in managing how apps access their information. When an app requires access to contact information, users can now allow access to specific contacts, not the full contact list. To keep other connections on the network private, developers can now seamlessly pair Bluetooth accessories without relying on other accessories nearby.
Apple Intelligence Makes iPad Even More Useful and Delightful
Deeply integrated into iPadOS 18 and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new, systemwide Writing Tools built into iPadOS 18, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
New image capabilities make communication and self-expression even more fun. With Image Playground, users can create playful images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Image Playground is easy to use, built right into apps like Messages, and also available in a dedicated app. In Notes, users can access Image Playground through the new Image Wand in the Apple Pencil tool palette, making notes even more visually engaging.
Memories in Photos lets users create the stories they want to see just by typing a description. Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on the description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc. In addition, a new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.
With the power of Apple Intelligence, Siri takes a major step forward, becoming even more natural, contextually relevant, and personal. Additionally, users can type to Siri, and switch between text and voice to communicate with Siri in whatever way feels right for the moment.
With Private Cloud Compute, Apple sets a new standard for privacy in AI, with the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers. When requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple and is only used to fulfill the user’s requests, and independent experts can verify this privacy promise.
Additionally, access to ChatGPT is integrated into Siri and systemwide Writing Tools across Apple’s platforms, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between tools.
Additional iPadOS 18 updates include:

And with more ways to help users effortlessly get things done, new Continuity features like iPhone Mirroring, major updates to Safari, and a host of new games, we think Mac users are going to love it.”
Wirelessly Use iPhone Right from Mac withiPhone Mirroring
macOS Sequoia makes Continuity even more magical with iPhone Mirroring, which allows users to fully access and engage with their iPhone — right from their Mac. A user’s custom wallpaper and icons appear just like on their iPhone, and they can swipe between pages on their Home Screen, or launch and browse any of their favorite apps. The keyboard, trackpad, and mouse on Mac also let a user interact with their iPhone, and audio even comes through. Users can seamlessly drag and drop between iPhone and Mac, and a user’s iPhone remains locked, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, which stays visible, so users can get information at a glance. Additionally, users can review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac.
Big Updates Come to Safari
Safari, the world’s fastest browser,2now offers Highlights, an even easier way to discover information on the web, such as directions, summaries, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows. A redesigned Reader includes even more ways to enjoy articles without distractions, featuring a streamlined view of the article a user is reading, a summary, and a table of contents for longer articles. And when Safari detects a video on the page, Viewer helps users put it front and center, while still giving them full access to system playback controls, including Picture in Picture.
Gaming Gets Even Better with Highly Anticipated Titles and More
Astellar lineup of games is coming to Mac — including the highly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the next installment in Ubisoft’s blockbuster series — alongside new features like Personalized Spatial Audio that make gaming even more immersive.
Window Tiling Is Easier and Faster Than Ever
Users can stay organized with new ways to arrange windows into a layout that works best for them. When a user drags a window to the edge of the screen, macOS Sequoia automatically suggests a tiled position on their desktop. Users can release their window right into place, quickly arrange tiles side by side, or place them in corners to keep even more apps in view. And new keyboard and menu shortcuts help users organize tiles even faster.
Video Conferencing Gets More Updates
The new presenter preview makes it easier to present, letting users see what they’re about to share before they share it, and works with apps like FaceTime and Zoom. Users can also apply beautiful built-in backgrounds, including a variety of color gradients and system wallpapers, or upload their own photos. Background replacements can be applied during a video call in FaceTime or in third-party apps like Webex, and with Apple’s industry-leading segmentation, users will look their best when on a call.
The New Passwords App Keeps Credentials Secure and Organized
Built on the foundation of Keychain, which was first introduced over 25 years ago, macOS Sequoia brings Passwords, a new app that makes it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one place. iCloud syncing is backed by secure end-to-end encryption. Passwords works great with Safari, and seamlessly syncs between a user’s Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app.
Apple Intelligence Ushers in the Next Chapter of AI on Mac
Deeply integrated into macOS Sequoia and built with privacy from the ground up, Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
New image capabilities make communication and self-expression even more fun. With Image Playground, users can create playful images in seconds, choosing from three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple extends its privacy leadership with new updates across its platforms
Private Cloud Compute sets a new standard for privacy in artificial intelligence
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced new updates across its platforms that help empower users and keep them in control of their data. Private Cloud Compute extends the industry-leading protections of iPhone to the cloud, so that users don’t have to choose between powerful intelligence grounded in their personal context and strong privacy protections. Apple also raised the bar for privacy with new features, such as locked and hidden apps, aimed at helping users protect sensitive areas of their phones. Apple introduced additional features designed with privacy and security in mind, including categorization in Mail, Messages via satellite, and presenter preview.
“Private Cloud Compute allows Apple Intelligence to process complex user requests with groundbreaking privacy,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “We’ve extended iPhone’s industry-leading security to the cloud, with what we believe is the most advanced security architecture ever deployed for cloud AI at scale. Private Cloud Compute uses your data only to fulfill your request, and never stores it, making sure it’s never accessible to anyone, including Apple. And we’ve designed the system so that independent experts can verify these protections.”
Superior Privacy for AI Capabilities
Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models right at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac, makes a user’s most personal devices even more useful and delightful.
A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, which delivers personal intelligence without collecting users’ data. In those times when a user needs models that are larger than what can fit in their pocket today,Private Cloud Computeallows Apple Intelligence to flex and scale its computational capacity, drawing on larger, server-based models to handle more complex requests, all while protecting user privacy.
When a user makes a request, Apple Intelligence analyzes whether it can be processed on device. If it needs greater computational capacity, it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, which will send only the data that is relevant to the task to be processed on Apple silicon servers. When requests are routed to Private Cloud Compute, data is not stored or made accessible to Apple, and is only used to fulfill the user’s requests.
The Apple silicon servers that form the foundation of Private Cloud Compute provide unprecedented cloud security. This starts with the Secure Enclave, which protects critical encryption keys on the server just as it does on a user’s iPhone, while Secure Boot ensures the OS running on the server is signed and verified, just like in iOS. Trusted Execution Monitor makes sure only signed and verified code runs, and attestation enables a user’s device to securely verify the identity and configuration of a Private Cloud Compute cluster before sending a request. And to verify Apple’s privacy promise, independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Private Cloud Compute servers.
More details on Private Cloud Compute can be found atsecurity.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute.
More Privacy Features Designed to Empower Users
Locked and hidden appsgive users peace of mind that others won’t inadvertently see something unintended when showing their screen to someone else, or handing them their device. Users can lock an app to protect its contents from view, or hide an app to help prevent others from seeing it. When a user locks an app, if someone tries to tap it, they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode. For additional privacy, a user can also hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder that requires Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to open.
“We relentlessly deliver on our commitment to give users the strongest and most innovative privacy protections,” said Erik Neuenschwander, Apple’s director of User Privacy. “This year is no exception, and the ability to lock and hide apps is just one example of Apple helping users remain in control of their information, even when they are sharing their devices with others.”
For years, Apple has worked to ensure that a user can share exactly what they want to, and with whom. In 2020, Apple introduced the Photos picker, which lets a user select photos and videos to use in an app, without requiring full Photo Library access. This year, Apple has two new features that expand on this protection. WithContacts permission improvementsiniOS 18, Apple is putting users in control by letting them choose which contacts to share with an app, rather than give an app access to all their contacts.Accessory Setup Kitalso allows developers to provide an intuitive new way to pair a user’s accessories without letting an app see all the other devices on their network, keeping their devices private and making pairing seamless.
Other new updates across Apple’s platforms make it easier than ever for users to take advantage of privacy and security features.
Building on the foundation of Keychain, which Apple first introduced more than 25 years ago, the newPasswordsapp makes it easy for users to access account passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and two-factor authentication codes stored securely in Keychain. The app also includes alerts for users regarding common weaknesses, such as passwords that can be easily guessed, have been used multiple times, or have appeared in known data leaks.
Additionally, the refreshedPrivacy & Securitysection in Settings surfaces glanceable information, so users can more easily understand the level of access each app has.
Additional Features Built with Privacy by Design
Apple has been building privacy and security protections into its apps and services for many years, and iOS 18,iPadOS 18, andmacOS Sequoiaare no exception.
With iOS 18,categorization in Mailoccurs entirely on a user’s iPhone, and automatically sorts messages into Primary, Promotions, Transactions, and Updates, letting users focus on the messages that matter to them most.
Messages via satellitein iOS 18enables users to message their friends and family directly from their existing iMessage and SMS conversations when they are without access to cellular connectivity or Wi-Fi.1When going off the grid, users can message over satellite right from the Messages app, while maintaining end-to-end encryption for iMessage.
Presenter previewin macOS Sequoia helps ensure users no longer have to worry about oversharing when they’re video conferencing, using AirPlay, or plugging in with a cable. With apps like FaceTime and Zoom, users can share their whole screen, or just an app, and presenter preview appears automatically.
Availability
The developer betas of iOS 18, iPad OS 18, and macOS Sequoia are available to Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today, and public betas will be available next month atbeta.apple.com. New software features will be available this fall as a free software update. Features are subject to change. Some features may not be available in all regions, all languages, or on all devices.

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced software updates across its Home products that supercharge entertainment and deliver greater everyday convenience. With tvOS 18, intelligent new features like InSight — and updates to Enhance Dialogue and subtitles — level up cinematic experiences, while new Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, and FaceTime capabilities get even better on users’ biggest screen. TheHome appgains new features with iOS 18, like guest access and hands-free unlock with home keys, delivering effortless and secure access to the home. tvOS 18 and iOS 18 are available as developer betas today, and will be available as free software updates this fall.
“We design our Home products to elevate users’ everyday lives, and our latest updates reinforce that goal by delivering even more convenience and connection,” said Stan Ng, Apple’s vice president of Apple Watch, Audio, Health, and Home Product Marketing. “This fall, tvOS 18 and our services take entertainment in the home to the next level by bringing timely information to fans about their favorite characters and scenes.”
tvOS 18 Takes Home Entertainment to the Next Level
This fall, theApple TV appintroduces InSight, a feature that displays timely information about actors, characters, and music from Apple TV+ movies and shows onscreen in real time. Users can simply select an actor to view their background and filmography page, or quickly view the song that is playing in a scene and add it to an Apple Music playlist. Viewers can also see InSight information on their iPhone when using it as an Apple TV remote.
Enhance Dialogue gets smarter with tvOS 18, leveraging machine learning and computational audio to deliver greater vocal clarity over music, action, and background noise on Apple TV 4K. In addition to HomePod speakers, users can now enjoy Enhance Dialogue when listening through built-in TV or HDMI-connected speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth-connected devices, and when playing supported content on iPhone and iPad.
Subtitles allow users to stay engaged with their favorite content. For even more convenience, subtitles now automatically appear at just the right moments with tvOS 18, including when the language in a show or film does not match the device language, when users mute, or when they skip back while watching something.
tvOS 18 also brings 21:9 support for playing movies and shows on projectors, and introduces stunning new screen savers like Portraits, TV and Movies, and even Snoopy, who takes over the screen with Woodstock in a delightful animation before coming to a rest in various locations, including his doghouse.
Apple Services and Experiences Get Even Better in the Home
This fall, anyone can share control of music playing from HomePod and HomePod mini using SharePlay and Apple Music. To join a SharePlay session, users can simply bring an iPhone close to another iPhone — or scan the QR code in the Apple Music SharePlay window on another iPhone — to add songs to the playlist and control playback, even if they do not have an Apple Music subscription.
New updates to FaceTime with Continuity Camera come with tvOS 18, making it more accessible than ever. With the introduction of Live Captions for English in the U.S. and Canada, users can read what others are saying on a FaceTime call — all from the biggest screen in the home.
Apple Fitness+ has been redesigned in tvOS 18 to help users make the most of its robust library, stay motivated, and keep consistent with their fitness routine. Updates include a personalized For You space, Explore and Library spaces, search features, and enhanced awards.
Home Entry and Understanding Electricity Use Get Even More Convenient
With iOS 18, the Home app introduces guest access, providing users with convenient ways to grant guests control of locks, garage doors, and security systems; schedule individualized or time-based access to the home with smart locks; and view Activity History for guests. Additionally, hands-free unlock with home keys allows users to instantly open supported entry locks as soon as they are six feet away from their door, for an even more effortless home entry experience.
The Home app also makes it easier for users to access, understand, and make more informed decisions about their home electricity use in partnership with leading utilities, beginning with Pacific Gas and Electric Company in California. Eligible users can easily view their electricity usage in the Home app’s Energy category when they connect their utility account.
Additional features coming to the Home app and Apple TV include:
Availability
The tvOS 18, iOS 18, and HomePod software version 18 developer betas are available for Apple Developer Program members atdeveloper.apple.comstarting today, and public betas will be available to users next month atbeta.apple.com.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Vision Pro arrives in new countries and regions beginning June 28
Customers in China mainland, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore can pre-order Apple Vision Pro on June 13, and customers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the U.K. can pre-order on June 28
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcedApple Vision Prowill expand to new countries and regions, with pre-orders for China mainland, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore beginning this Thursday, June 13, at 6 p.m. PT and availability beginning Friday, June 28. Customers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom can pre-order Vision Pro beginning Friday, June 28, at 5 a.m. PT, with availability beginning Friday, July 12. Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world to deliver powerful spatial experiences that transform the way people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, enjoy entertainment, and much more.
“The enthusiasm for Apple Vision Pro has been extraordinary, and we are thrilled to introduce the magic of spatial computing to more customers around the world,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We can’t wait for more people to see the impossible become possible, whether working and collaborating with an infinite canvas for apps, reliving treasured memories in three dimensions, watching TV shows and movies in a one-of-a-kind personal cinema, or enjoying brand-new spatial experiences that defy imagination.”
A Revolutionary Spatial Computer
Apple Vision Pro is powered by visionOS, a revolutionary operating system, intuitive spatial user interface, and magical input system that users navigate with their eyes, hands, and voice. visionOS is built upon decades of engineering and design innovation in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, and works seamlessly with Apple’s ecosystem of hardware, software, and services to deliver a delightful experience across users’ favorite Apple devices.
Users interact with apps by simply looking at them and tapping their fingers together. They can also speak to dictate text, use the virtual keyboard to type, and ask Siri to open and close apps, play media, answer questions, and more. The infinite canvas frees apps from the boundaries of a physical display, so they can appear side by side at any scale, providing users with the ultimate workspace for productivity, collaboration, and entertainment. Environments — stunning, dynamic landscapes like Haleakalā, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, and even the moon — are designed to help users focus, reduce visual clutter, and enjoy immersive experiences.
WithvisionOS 2, available as a free software update this fall, all Apple Vision Pro users will gain access to even more features that enhance how they engage with spatial computing, including a powerful way to transform photos into 3D memories; intuitive hand gestures to easily access the Home View and important information at a glance; new capabilities for Mac Virtual Display, Travel Mode, and Guest User; enhancements to Mindfulness, Safari, and the Apple TV app; and much more.
A Robust Catalog of Apps, Games, and Experiences
The App Store now features more than 2,000 apps designed for Apple Vision Pro; more than 1.5 million compatible iOS and iPadOS apps; and even more apps on Mac using Mac Virtual Display that work seamlessly alongside one another.1The unique capabilities of Vision Pro, paired with apps built by Apple’s worldwide developer community, make it a remarkably versatile device for users.
An Enormous, Private, and Portable WorkspaceLeading business and productivity apps — including Box, Craft, Fantastical, MindNode, Slack, Things 3, Webex, Zoom, and apps from Microsoft 365 — help users collaborate with colleagues and accomplish everyday tasks. Users can also supercharge their productivity with utility apps such as AirLauncher, GlanceBar, Splitscreen, Screens 5, and Widgetsmith — and by pairing Bluetooth accessories, such as Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and with visionOS 2 later this year, Magic Mouse.
An Unmatched Personal CinemaTop streaming services are available on Apple Vision Pro, including Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ with Hulu, Max, MUBI, Peacock, Paramount+ with Showtime, Pluto TV, and Tubi.2The Apple TV app features all Apple Originals from Apple TV+, and more than 250 3D movies, with select titles available to Apple TV+ subscribers at no additional cost.3Vision Pro users can enjoy more streaming and online video services through apps like IMAX, Juno, Supercut, and Television, or through Safari. Apps that support SharePlay and spatial Persona allow multiple users to watch together, as if they’re in the same physical space.4
A Front-Row Seat and Personal Scoreboard for SportsWith apps from major sports leagues and brands — including the NBA, MLS, MLB, NHL, PGA TOUR, The Masters, UFC, World Surf League, and Red Bull TV — Apple Vision Pro users have the opportunity to watch games and follow athletes like never before. Features like multiview, real-time player and game stats, live object mapping, and more bring the benefits of a physical scoreboard or second screen right into view. Fans can also follow live local, national, and international sports with apps from top cable services and sports broadcasters.
An Incredible Gaming DeviceUsers can explore thousands of fun games, including more than 250 titles with Apple Arcade. New spatial games and content updates launch on Apple Arcade regularly, with recent releases such as Alto’s Odyssey — The Lost City, Crossy Road Castle, and Where Cards Fall, alongside spatial games on the App Store, such as the 2024 Apple Design Award-winning Blackbox, Loóna, and DapTap. Popular immersive games, like Job Simulator, shine on Apple Vision Pro, allowing players to simply use their eyes and hands to simulate various professions, like a gourmet chef or store clerk. Players can also access iPad and iPhone games, PC and console games using apps like Steam Link, and even more games on Mac — which are all compatible with PlayStation DualSense and Xbox Wireless controllers.
An Infinite Canvas for CreativityNew design apps like AirDraw and Da Vinci Eye have been built to leverage the unique capabilities of spatial computing, like the ability for users to sketch, draw, and paint with just their eyes and hands. The 2024 Apple Design Award-winning app djay empowers artists to make music out of thin air, while Lowe’s Style Studio allows users to design their dream kitchen.
Groundbreaking Storytelling ExperiencesApple Vision Pro introduces Apple Immersive Video, a storytelling format that leverages 3D 8K video with a 180-degree field of view and Spatial Audio to transport viewers to the center of the action. The Apple TV app is home to a growing slate of Apple Immersive films and series, while the App Store features unique immersive and interactive experiences, including Encounter Dinosaurs, GUCCI’s filmWho Is Sabato De Sarno? A Gucci Story, and the recently launched What If…? An Immersive Story from Marvel Studios and ILM Immersive.
This month, developers around the world are launching new apps and games for Apple Vision Pro, including DingTalk, Douyin VR Live, Migu Video, Taobao, Tencent Video, and Weibo in China; apps from Yahoo! JAPAN, LIFULL HOME’S, U-NEXT, and Nikkei in Japan; and Singtel CAST, StarHub TV+, and mewatch in Singapore — all available from day one. More apps will launch on Vision Pro next month, including Soul Spire in the United Kingdom; Canal+, Foxar, OQEE, and SeLoger in France; BILD, OTTO, and ZDF in Germany; Classix and Sportsnet in Canada; and Domain in Australia. Additionally, global productivity tools like apps from Microsoft 365, entertainment services like Disney+, and more will be available in many of these countries and regions at launch.
Businessesacross industries are embracing spatial computing, with more than half of the Fortune 100 companies having purchased Apple Vision Pro to develop innovative solutions for their organizations and customers, including apps to collaborate on 3D designs, deliver specialized employee training, guide remote fieldwork, and much more. Vision Pro is also unlocking new opportunities forhealthcareprofessionals and medical institutions in areas such as clinical education, surgical planning, medical imaging, and behavioral health.
Unrivaled Hardware Design and Innovation
Apple Vision Pro is designed to deliver phenomenal compute performance in a compact, wearable form factor. The ultra-high-resolution display system uses micro-OLED technology to pack 23 million pixels into two displays, each the size of a postage stamp, delivering more pixels than a 4K TV to each eye. The advanced Spatial Audio system uses two individually amplified drivers to deliver Personalized Spatial Audio, creating the feeling that sounds are coming from the space around the user. Vision Pro also features a high-performance eye tracking system for responsive, intuitive input, and EyeSight helps users stay connected to the people around them. Vision Pro is powered by Apple silicon in a unique dual-chip design. M2 delivers powerful standalone performance, while the first-of-its-kind R1 chip processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it’s appearing right in front of the user’s eyes.
Apple Vision Pro Embodies Apple’s Values
As with all Apple products, Apple’s values are embedded into Apple Vision Pro:
Apple Vision Pro and the Environment
Apple Vision Pro is designed with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled tin soldering and gold plating in multiple printed circuit boards. Vision Pro meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury, brominated flame retardants, PVC, and beryllium. The packaging is 100 percent fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of eliminating plastics in all packaging by 2025. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for its global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to be carbon neutral across the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product.

“So many of our users rely on Apple services throughout their day, from navigating their commute with Apple Maps, to making easy and secure payments with Apple Pay, to curating playlists with Apple Music,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “We’re excited to give them even more to love about our services, like the ability to explore national parks with hikes in Apple Maps, redeem rewards or access installments with Apple Pay, and enjoy music with loved ones through SharePlay in Apple Music.”
More Ways to Explore the World with Apple Maps
Apple Maps introduces even more ways to explore the world, including hikes and custom walking routes. Users can browse thousands of hikes across national parks in the United States — filtered by length, elevation, and route type — and save them to use while offline. Users can also create their own custom walking routes with just a few taps to plan everything from a local exercise route to a full-day walking tour in a new city. Additionally, they can save their favorite national park hikes, custom walking routes, and places to an all-new Places Library, and add personal notes about them.
Greater Flexibility with Apple Pay
Apple Pay introduces even more flexibility and choice for users when they check out online and in-app. Users can view and redeem rewards, and access installment loan offerings from eligible credit or debit cards, when making a purchase online or in-app with iPhone and iPad.1These features will be available for any Apple Pay-enabled bank or issuer to integrate in supported markets.
The ability to redeem rewards for a purchase with Apple Pay will be available beginning in the U.S. with Discover and Synchrony, and across Apple Pay issuers with Fiserv.

With this feature enabled, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music accessible in their apps.
An Optimized Viewing Experience for Apple TV
The Apple TV app introduces InSight, a feature that displays timely information about actors, characters, and music from Apple TV+ movies and shows onscreen in real time.

UPDATE
HBCU students chart their career paths in America’s Music City
Launched in collaboration with Apple through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, the yearlong PROPEL Center Arts & Entertainment Industry Accelerator is designed to bolster diversity throughout the industry
Empathy and storytelling. Motivational and strategic leadership. These are just a handful of the qualities participants in this year’s PROPEL Center Arts & Entertainment Industry Accelerator identified in their “What’s Your Superpower?” course, designed to empower students to uncover and embrace their authentic selves throughout their careers.
“I think the empathy comes from me being a first child. I’ve always looked out for my younger siblings and cousins and wanted to make sure that they are good,” says Liza Montgomery, a 2024 mass communications graduate from Xavier University of Louisiana. Montgomery was one of more than 100 students from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) who were selected for PROPEL’s creative arts accelerator.
Discovering their superpowers is just one way students are learning to prepare for their careers after graduation. Since February, the students have completed micro-credential courses through the PROPEL Learn app, participated in virtual career panels with professionals at Apple, and attended résumé-writing workshops to build their portfolios and begin preparing for their career journeys.
This summer, 50 participants — including Montgomery — were selected from 19 HBCUs to attend an immersive 10-day experience on the campuses of Tennessee State University in Nashville and Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta. There, they received mentorship from HBCU faculty and industry professionals in both creative and executive roles, and worked side by side with experts at the Apple Music Nashville office.
The accelerator was launched with the PROPEL Center as part of Apple’s $25 million investment through its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to help dismantle systemic barriers to opportunity and combat injustices faced by communities of color. Its curricula was designed to provide new pathways for HBCU students into careers in industries that are notoriously competitive.
“Subject-matter experts are everything along this journey,” says Dr. Lisa Herring, the PROPEL Center’s president. “There’s nothing more powerful than for a student to be able to interface with someone who is the expert as they seek to become one. Apple’s belief in being able to not only be a partner, but to be at the table, move from the table, and then be in the field, and then be side by side with our students and instructors — that’s commitment down to the details.”
The PROPEL Center is a first-of-its-kind global innovation and learning hub for HBCUs. To support the next generation of diverse leaders, PROPEL provides educational programming and career preparation across a wide range of disciplines, including AI, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design, and the creative arts. Experts from Apple help develop the curricula, and provide ongoing mentorship and internship opportunities.
“When we launched our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative four years ago, we did so with a clear mission to advance equity and create greater access to opportunity for under-resourced communities,” says Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “These are persistent and systemic challenges, and we are committed to working with partners, including PROPEL Center, to close the existing gaps and achieve meaningful change. Our collaboration with PROPEL is designed to provide talented students with the technology, resources, and expertise they need to become industry leaders, whether they pursue roles in arts and entertainment, technology, or beyond.”
In Nashville, students visited the National Museum of African American Music for a fireside chat with Ebro Darden, Apple Music’s global editorial head of Hip Hop and R&B; got hands-on with experts in their fields at the Apple Music Nashville office and Universal Music Group’s East Iris Studios; and participated in an experience with the Apple Downtown Nashville store.
Accelerator participants also collaborated on projects that speak to this year’s theme, “Propelling Preservation.” Through their work, the 10-person teams showcased how Black creatives have contributed to social movements — and how they can ignite a new era that sustains HBCU culture for future generations.
“‘Propelling preservation’ is about documenting the people that haven’t had a voice,” Montgomery says. “What I’ve been trying to do with my art is accurately communicate the voices and experiences that haven’t been included for a very long time. For me, it’s about making sure I’m documenting people of color’s stories, and what they look like in their most authentic and vibrant states.”
“A lot of times, when people think Black social justice movement, they think negative,” adds Emmanuel Strickland, a Tennessee State University student and emerging R&B singer who is one of Montgomery’s teammates. “We’re trying to flip it to a positive. Our project is about HBCU love and different things that we go through as college students on a daily basis — how we move together as a unit. No matter what HBCU you go to, you’re going to be able to relate.”
As part of the project, each team was assigned a genre and tasked to record a music single, put together a marketing plan, shoot a visual campaign using iPhone, and pitch their concept to a panel of judges made up of industry professionals.
In her role, Montgomery designed the marketing plan and the cover art for her group’s song. While using Apple Pencil and the Procreate app on her iPad Pro, she was grateful for its speed and the versatility the app’s tools provide.
“The way Procreate and my iPad with Apple Pencil can imitate a traditionally drawn art piece is amazing because it’s not just a flat piece,” she explains. “It has the capacity to show dimension, texture, shiny objects, and even animation. Using Procreate really makes the possibilities pretty limitless for digital artworks.”
Growing up, Strickland — who performs under the name “Mille Manny” — was constantly surrounded by music. His home was filled with the sounds of his mother and sisters’ voices belting out tunes from female superstars including Mariah Carey, Selena, and even Beyoncé. “Being from Memphis, you’re born with that soul in you,” he says.
As his career takes off, Strickland is always thinking up his next song. When inspiration strikes, he records lyrics and melodies in Voice Memos on his iPhone 13 Pro Max. And at home, his MacBook and Neumann microphone serve as a mini studio as he produces tracks in Pro Tools.
During the accelerator, Strickland, Montgomery, and their teammates collaborated with artist, producer, musician, and songwriter Fresh Ayr — who provided the beat for their track — and the audio engineering team at UMG East Iris Studios to produce their song in Logic Pro. This level of access and visibility for the students is just one of the benefits of the program.
“The biggest ‘aha’ moment for me would probably be understanding that it’s not what you see on the surface, but what’s underneath,” says Strickland. “The accelerator is enlightening, showing how to do a tour, or this is what’s going on behind the scenes. We’re realizing that it’s more than just a couple of people that you can see making things happen.”
“The PROPEL program does a really great job of giving HBCU students a platform to truly show who we are. We are given the opportunity to express ourselves artistically, build invaluable relationships, and have authentic conversations with industry professionals who are in positions that we aspire to be in as we grow throughout our careers,” Montgomery adds.
As the aspiring creatives, musicians, and even accountants and lawyers made their way around Nashville during the accelerator, that level of access to industry professionals was invaluable. The students took part in candid conversations about how the industry works, gained deeper insight into unexpected areas with the most opportunities for new talent, and learned from the personal experiences of artists like Kirk Franklin, a world-renowned gospel musician who had to navigate the historically inaccessible industry on his own.
“A lot of the students are coming from various schools and various backgrounds,” says Sylvester Polk, a music engineering mentor at the accelerator who teaches music technology at Bethune-Cookman University, an HBCU in Daytona Beach, Florida. “Some of them have been exposed to a lot already, some of them don’t have any idea. There’s so many fields and so many skills that are required in various areas that it can be open to lots of people. The accelerator has been great for providing the students with a holistic understanding of what the industry is and how it works, and PROPEL has been able to provide an extension to the classroom.”
“It allows us to be in the room. It allows us to be heard. It allows us to have the reach to actually talk to the people who are in the industry that we’re aspiring to be in,” says Strickland. “With this program, there are going to be internships that come out of this. There will be apprenticeships that come out of this. There are going to be real-life connections that people can foster, nurture, and potentially really make something shake with.”

UPDATE
Apple helps launch Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund to expedite construction of hundreds of new affordable homes
Across the state, Apple’s $2.5 billion commitment is creating more affordable housing for Californians
Apple is teaming up with the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, Sobrato Philanthropies, and Destination: Home — all experts in affordable housing development — to launch the new Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund. This fund, which will make targeted, favorable loans to advance affordable housing development, is part of Apple’s broader $2.5 billion commitment to address housing affordability in communities across California.
“We believe everyone deserves a place to call home, and we’re proud that Apple’s $2.5 billion initiative is supporting more affordable housing options across the state,” said Kristina Raspe, Apple’s vice president of Global Real Estate and Facilities. “Increasing access to safe and affordable housing is essential for thriving communities here, and we’re excited to help launch the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund as part of our long-term commitment to our home state.”
With an initial $50 million investment, the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund will support four projects in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, creating more than 400 homes within the next two years. Using proven methods, the fund is uniquely focused on removing barriers that affordable housing developers frequently encounter in order to deliver high-quality units faster and for significantly less than current industry averages.
“We cannot effectively address the homelessness and affordability crises in the Bay Area if we continue building and funding affordable housing in the same way,” explained Rebecca Foster, CEO of the San Francisco Housing Accelerator Fund, which will manage the new fund. “We must think outside the box to significantly reduce costs and timelines. This fund is designed to showcase what is possible when we have clear goals, a shared commitment to meet these targets, and a simplified financing structure. We’re so grateful to Apple for helping to anchor this fund and bringing their innovative thinking to this important community work.”
Next week, Mercy Housing will celebrate breaking ground on a new affordable development in San Francisco’s Mission District, marking the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund’s first project to begin construction. The project will provide 145 units of permanent supportive housing for seniors experiencing or at imminent risk of experiencing homelessness. The fund’s anticipated second project is expected to break ground in Santa Cruz later this year.
Including this new investment in the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, Apple has now allocated over $1.6 billion to supporting affordable housing initiatives in California, directly benefitting more than 60,000 Californians. With support from Apple, affordable housing developers are building or preserving more than 10,000 units across more than 90 developments statewide — many of which have already been completed and are currently housing community members. Apple has also helped more than 35,000 Bay Area residents who were at risk of losing their homes remain housed, and has assisted more than 2,500 first-time homebuyers finance their homes.
In addition to the three Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund anchor partners, Apple is also working with Housing Trust Silicon Valley, California Housing Finance Agency, United Way of Greater Los Angeles, and developers across California to address the state’s housing crisis.

UPDATE
Leagues Cup returns to MLS Season Pass on Apple TV on July 26
The World Cup-style tournament features all 47 clubs from Major League Soccer and Liga MX in a monthlong tournament across North America
Leagues Cup, the first in-season club tournament in North America across all men’s professional sports, begins tomorrow, July 26, and MLS Season Pass will be the only place where fans can watch every match.
The World Cup-style, monthlong tournament features all 47 clubs from Major League Soccer and Mexico’s Liga MX. All clubs pause their regular seasons to participate in the tournament, which concludes with the top three teams receiving automatic bids to the 2025 Concacaf Champions Cup. Leagues Cup includes 77 matches in stadiums across the U.S. and Canada, and fans in more than 100 countries and regions can enjoy all the action with an MLS Season Pass subscription.
The upcoming tournament is the second in a historic 10-year partnership between Apple and Major League Soccer. Over 1.3 million fans attended Leagues Cup matches in its inaugural year, 2023, when Inter Miami CF defeated Nashville SC to become the first-ever Leagues Cup champions. Lionel Messi, who made his MLS debut for Inter Miami during last year’s Leagues Cup, was awarded Best Player and Top Scorer with a tournament-best 10 goals.
“I’m really looking forward to the kickoff of Leagues Cup,” said Columbus Crew’s Cucho Hernández. “It’s always going to be exciting winning titles with this club — we are in a very positive dynamic as a group, want to achieve things, and will give it our all in every game. It will also be exciting for fans who can enjoy watching teams from farther away that they may not have been able to see live.”
“Leagues Cup matchups are fun and entertaining for both players and fans, and I’m excited to play against teams from Liga MX,” said LAFC’s Denis Bouanga. “The tournament is a great opportunity to win a trophy, and we’re always trying to win more trophies at LAFC.”
“For me, it’s all about competition — that’s nonnegotiable,” said Tigres UANL’s André-Pierre Gignac. “It’s been great to see the growth of Leagues Cup, and I’m excited to compete.”
“It’s an honor to compete with MLS in Leagues Cup, which is a beautiful tournament,” said CF Monterrey’s Germán Berterame. “I’m looking forward to the matches and hope that this time will be in favor of LMX!”

2024-08-14,Increase,Developers can soon offer in‑app NFC transactions using the Secure Element,"Text of this article
August 14, 2024
UPDATE
Developers can soon offer in‑app NFC transactions using the Secure Element
Starting with iOS 18.1, developers will be able to offer NFC contactless transactions using the Secure Element from within their own apps on iPhone, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. Using the new NFC and SE (Secure Element) APIs, developers will be able to offer in-app contactless transactions for in-store payments, car keys, closed-loop transit, corporate badges, student IDs, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty and rewards cards, and event tickets, with government IDs to be supported in the future.
As users’ security and privacy is of the utmost importance to Apple, this new solution was designed to provide developers with a secure way to offer NFC contactless transactions from within their iOS apps. TheNFC and SE APIsleverage the Secure Element — an industry-standard, certified chip designed to store sensitive information securely on device. Apple has dedicated significant resources to design a solution that protects users’ security and privacy, leveraging a number of Apple’s proprietary hardware and software technologies when making a contactless transaction, including the Secure Enclave, biometric authentication, and Apple servers. To make a contactless transaction within an app that utilizes these APIs, users can either open the app directly, or set the app as their default contactless app in iOS Settings, and double-click the side button on iPhone to initiate a transaction.
To incorporate this new solution in their iPhone apps, developers will need to enter into a commercial agreement with Apple, request the NFC and SE entitlement, and pay the associated fees. This ensures that only authorized developers who meet certain industry and regulatory requirements, and commit to Apple’s ongoing security and privacy standards, can access the relevant APIs. The NFC and SE APIs will be available to developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the U.K., and the U.S. in an upcoming developer seed for iOS 18.1, with additional locations to follow. Developers and users will continue to have access to the easy, secure, and private experience of Apple Pay and Wallet.

2024-08-15,Increase,Driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet are coming soon to California,"Text of this article
August 15, 2024
UPDATE
Driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet are coming soon to California
IDs in Apple Wallet will offer Californians an easy, secure, and private way to present their California driver’s licenses and state IDs with an iPhone and Apple Watch
Californians will soon be able to add their driver’s licenses and state IDs to Apple Wallet, providing a seamless and secure way to present driver’s licenses or state IDs using just an iPhone or Apple Watch.
“We’re excited to be working with the state of California to bring IDs in Apple Wallet to Apple’s home state soon, and provide residents with an easy, secure, and private way to present their California driver’s license and state ID in person and in app using Apple Wallet,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “Whether using IDs in Apple Wallet to breeze through travel, or to securely verify age or identity at businesses, California driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet make ID presentment seamless — all with the security built into iPhone and Apple Watch.”
Users with an ID in Apple Wallet can use their iPhone or Apple Watch to present their ID in person at select TSA security checkpoints and businesses, as well as in select apps to verify their age or identity.
Security and Privacy
Apple Wallet uses the privacy and security features that are built into iPhone and Apple Watch to help protect a user’s identity and personal information. When adding an ID to Apple Wallet, the state-issuing authority receives only information they need to approve or deny adding the driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet.
When presenting a driver’s license and state ID in Apple Wallet, only the information needed for the transaction is presented, and users will need to review and authorize using Face ID or Touch ID before the information is shared. Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID.
A user’s ID information is encrypted and stored only on their device, so others, including Apple, cannot access it unless a user chooses to present it. Apple and the state-issuing authority do not know when or where or with whom a user presents their driver’s license or state ID, and Apple doesn’t see or retain any presentment information that can be tied back to a user. If a user misplaces their iPhone or Apple Watch, they can use the Find My app to lock their device and help locate it, or remotely erase it.
Today, IDs in Apple Wallet are available in five other states: Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, Georgia, and most recently, Ohio.
For more information on IDs in Wallet, visitlearn.wallet.apple/id.
The launch will be a part of the California DMV’s mDL pilot program. More information on California’s mDL pilot can be found atdmv.ca.gov/mDL.

UPDATE
Apple celebrates America’s national parks with an Apple Pay donation campaign and new ways to explore with Apple Maps
Today through August 25, Apple will donate $10 to the National Park Foundation for each purchase made through Apple using Apple Pay
As the U.S. National Park Service marks its 108th birthday this week, Apple is celebrating with more ways to support and experience America’s parks. Today through August 25, Apple will make a $10 donation to the National Park Foundation for every purchase made with Apple Pay onapple.com, in the Apple Store app, or at an Apple Store in the U.S.1Additionally, this fall, Apple Maps will make it even easier for users to explore national parks with details for thousands of hikes.
For eight years, Apple has engaged customers in support for the National Park Foundation as part of the company’s long-standing efforts to protect and connect communities to America’s national parks. This includes sharing content and resources across Apple platforms that bring users closer to these treasured places, from the “Nature Awaits” playlist onApple Musicnow playing in retail stores across the country, to over 30Apple Maps Guidescurated by the National Park Foundation.
“Every time I visit a national park, I’m struck by their extraordinary beauty and incredibly rich history,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “We’re proud to partner with the National Park Foundation to help preserve these natural treasures that inspire so many people. Their important work helps ensure that future generations will be able to experience that same sense of awe, wonder, and reverence for the planet we call home.”
Supporting the Next Generation of Park Champions
The National Park Foundation funds programs across the country that ensure America’s national parks remain a place where nature can thrive and visitors can learn and explore. Programs like Field Science and ParkVentures are creating pathways for youth to engage in immersive learning experiences and explore STEM career paths, while addressing barriers to access and engagement with parks. For example, Apple’s support has helped fund the EcoLogik Institute’s important work to foster the next generation of park champions.
This summer, in collaboration with Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego, California, the organization is supporting young explorers and scientists ages 10 to 16 — empowering them to discover and deepen their connection to nature and see themselves as scientists, engineers, innovators, and leaders who can make a difference. Through apprenticeships and other work experiences, participants gain valuable on-the-ground experience in natural resources science career fields.
For 17-year-old Addison Shapiro, the experience at EcoLogik camp was transformative and evolved into new opportunities to engage in fieldwork and support species monitoring surveys at Cabrillo. “EcoLogik has given me an amazing community,” said Addison. “I’ve made so many lifelong friends and met inspiring women in STEM who have not only broadened my perspective, but also motivated me to pursue a career in the life sciences.”
“By investing in the interest and passion of young women and girls who want to explore careers in STEM, we can empower them to become the next generation of environmental stewards,” said Will Shafroth, the National Park Foundation’s president and CEO. “The EcoLogik Institute’s project is proof that when we nurture a love of science, provide access to national parks, and equip young women like Addison with the tools to succeed, they will see their potential come to life. With the support of Apple, together we’re creating a future where every girl can see herself as the next scientist, park ranger, and other endless aspirations.”
New Ways to Enjoy and Explore National Parks
This fall, Apple Maps will introduce new features to help users explore the world. Across U.S. national parks, users will be able to browse thousands of hikes in Maps — filtered by length, elevation, and route type — and follow along with turn-by-turn guidance. In addition, users across the U.S. can explore topographic maps on iPhone with contour lines, trail details, and more. They can also build custom walking routes to tailor their adventures to their personal preferences, whether for a steep, uphill climb or a leisurely walk in nature. All national park hikes and custom routes can be saved and accessed offline while away from cell service or Wi‑Fi.
This week, Apple users can celebrate the nature, history, and heritage of national parks at home or while exploring. On August 25, Apple Watch users around the world can earn a limited-edition award and animated stickers for Messages by recording any workout of 20 minutes or more.
Apple’s efforts to help people enjoy and access national parks are part of the company’s broader global commitment to support communities and protect the planet. Today, Apple is carbon neutral across its global corporate operations, and is making significant progress towardApple 2030: the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across the entire supply chain and lifetime use of every product by the end of this decade.

UPDATE
College students head to campus with Mac and iPad
This month, students around the world are heading off to college, ready for the next chapter of their academic careers and beyond. As many delve into the intricacies of fields as varied as organic chemistry, the visual arts, and medicine, they’re trusting Apple’s ecosystem of products to power through their days. From creating apps, to taking bio notes, designing presentations, and editing video projects, college students turn to Mac and iPad for their longevity, portability, and reliability.
And with the rollout of Apple Intelligence — the personal intelligence system that puts powerful generative models at the core of Mac, iPad, and iPhone while setting a new standard for privacy — this fall, they’ll have even more tools to tackle the increasing demands of their fields.1
“My MacBook Air goes with me everywhere I go and excels at all the work I demand from it, whether running AutoCAD to design a new machine, taking notes for organic chemistry, or building my next app in Xcode — MacBook Air unlocks completely new possibilities for me,” explains Brayden Gogis, a rising junior at Taylor University in Indiana and a three-time Swift Student Challenge winner who is studying mechanical engineering and biochemistry.
Research shows that students’ course of study plays a major role in choosing their primary device. In fact, 65 percent said this was an important factor, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Below, three students majoring in STEM fields share why they have made Mac and iPad their trusted campus companions.
After attending the University of Notre Dame in Indiana for her undergraduate studies, Yoora Jung is now in her second year of medical school at Touro University California in the San Francisco Bay Area.
A longtime user of Apple products, she relies on iPad Air for her studies, and her MacBook Pro for creating content for social media, where she’s earned a sizable following with her inside look at what it’s really like being a medical school student.
“I use iPad Air and Apple Pencil to take handwritten notes using Notability, and to organize lecture materials for effective study sessions,” Jung says.
Jung is also looking forward to the rollout of Apple Intelligence features, such as Writing Tools, which can help students rewrite, proofread, and summarize text when tidying up class notes or crafting important emails.
“Apple Intelligence will be a game changer,” Jung says. “Being able to automatically generate summaries of lecture recordings and transcripts will make studying more productive, and help me quickly adjust my notes and emails for tone, in addition to grammar or spelling errors.”
To handle the intensive demands of his medical school curriculum at Central India’s Government Medical College, Nagpur, Anuj Pachhel opted for MacBook Pro. “One aspect I loved was the battery life on the device,” says Pachhel, who will continue his postgraduate studies this fall. “I had e-books for studies loaded on my Mac and used it extensively, and I was in awe of the speed.”
Throughout his undergraduate years, Pachhel documented his academic adventures with iPhone and Mac, earning more than a million followers as he discussed what it was like studying for exams, attending college during the COVID-19 lockdowns, and what he did with his scarce free time along the way.
“The Mac is so powerful at handling challenging tasks,” Pachhel explains. “I particularly love DaVinci Resolve Studio, as it uses many artificial intelligence features that tap the fast Neural Engine of my MacBook Pro, improving my editing speed.”
Across the Apple ecosystem, Continuity features like Handoff and Universal Clipboard help keep students like Brayden Gogis on task as they power through their busiest days on campus.
“The more I use my Mac, the more I get out of it,” Gogis explains. “I can go on my iPhone and see all of my notes for class that I type on my MacBook Air if I want to quickly study, and all of my texts, calendar events, and reminders sync between them. It keeps me organized and on track when I’m being pulled in a million different directions.”
During the school year, his most-used apps include Bear, a note-taking app; the Reminders and Calendar apps for staying on task; and Keynote for creating top-notch presentations. “Keynote has so many features for making a really impressive presentation in the simplest way possible,” Gogis says. “The animations make it a lot easier to communicate organic chemistry mechanisms that look intimidating as a static image.”
As Gogis and his fellow students head back to campus this fall with Mac and iPad, they’re prepared for the semester ahead, and for wherever their academic and future career journeys take them.
Head Back to School with Apple
Whether students choose Mac or iPad, affordability is key. Apple is celebrating the student experience with a limited-time college student offer in Apple Store locations and online at theApple Education Store. The offer includes a gift card up to $150 in the U.S. for purchase of Mac or iPad, including the newMacBook Air— the world’s most popular laptop — and the all-newiPad Air.
To add to their savings, college and graduate students, their parents, and all teachers are eligible to receive discounted education pricing year-round and 20 percent off AppleCare+ during this limited-time offer. They can trade in an old device to earn credit toward a new one and take advantage of 0 percent interest financing over 24 months.
To help students narrow in on the perfect laptop, Apple has also launched anew Today at Apple sessionavailable for students to take at their local Apple Store, and the “Help me choose” service online. Students can also shop with a specialist, who will guide them based on personal college goals, customize features and apps to fit their needs, and explore options to fit their unique budget, in stores and online. For more information, visit an Apple Store or theApple Education Storeonline.

2024-08-21,Decrease,Apple and 4-H are bringing technology to a new generation of learners,"Technology is giving us more tools to use with our projects, so we’re learning skills that we can use later on in life.
Jobie Thinthapthai, 12, 4-H participant
Text of this article

UPDATE
Apple and 4-H are bringing technology to a new generation of learners
The name 4-H traditionally conjures up images of teenagers raising farm animals, or learning how to bake or sew — and those skills are still a big part of the organization that has helped support and educate young people across America for more than 100 years. On a recent day at the Franklin County Fair in Columbus, Ohio, 4-H club members presented livestock and displayed quilts they had crafted, but on closer inspection, there were signs of something new, and perhaps surprising.
Outside a 4-H mobile classroom bus parked near the fair’s midway, kids were using iPad to drive Sphero robots across the pavement, while inside, they were coding with Swift and composing music using GarageBand.
In a nearby barn, 15-year-old Calum Williams was preparing to show one of the ducks he raised by reviewing Notes on his iPad.
“I like how 4-H is very inclusive,” says Williams. “Even if you’re not interested in livestock or sewing or cooking, which 4-H is really known for, there are a lot of other things you can do that incorporate technology, like STEM projects. 4-H has changed a lot, and it’s still changing.”
4-H is the largest youth development organization in the U.S., reaching more than 6 million young people across every county and parish in the nation each year. The organization is directly tied to land-grant universities, which were created in the late 19th century to increase admittance to higher education, with an emphasis on agricultural and engineering skills.
In recent years, 4-H has expanded to include greater access to technology, thanks in part to support from Apple and its Community Education Initiative (CEI). Since Apple launched CEI in 2019, the programming has provided coding, creativity, and career opportunities to tens of thousands of students in 99 countries and regions, and across all 50 states, with an emphasis on communities that are traditionally underrepresented in technology. CEI is part of Apple’s broader commitment to education and educational equity, dating back more than four decades.
Apple’s work to bring cutting-edge technology to one of America’s most cherished community programs started in Ohio in conjunction with The Ohio State University, providing hardware, financial support, scholarships, educator resources, and access to Apple experts. The collaboration has grown significantly since that initial partnership in Ohio. Between 2019 and spring 2024, Apple-supported 4-H programs reached thousands of educators and more than 90,000 young people across Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, and Florida, including through programming at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. By the end of this summer, nearly 8,000 more students will have been introduced to the program, with expansions into Illinois, Kentucky, and Idaho. Programming in North Carolina is set to begin this fall, in collaboration with North Carolina State University.
Jobie Thinthapthai, 12, has been part of 4-H for four years. At this year’s Franklin County Fair, in addition to showing the pig and rabbit she raised, she visited the 4-H mobile classroom bus for the first time. The bus is outfitted with iPad stations where kids can explore robotics, coding, music composition, and art.
“It was really cool, and I especially liked working with the robots and drawing on iPad,” says Thinthapthai, who wants to be a doctor when she’s older. “Medicine is constantly advancing with technology, so learning about that can help with my future. And it’s the same with 4-H — technology is giving us more tools to use with our projects, so we’re learning skills that we can use later on in life.”
Mark Light is one of the educators who runs the 4-H bus. He started his career as a civil engineer before joining 4-H to lead STEM programming in Ohio.
“In our state, we have 200 different 4-H project areas for kids to explore, and only 10 percent are livestock- or agriculture-related,” says Light, who was a 4-H club member in high school. “Technology is a big part of 4-H, and when kids pick up an iPad or Apple Pencil on the bus, it becomes the spark that gets them excited about learning new skills. I love when we have parents saying ‘It’s time to get off the bus and go on fair rides,’ and the kids don’t want to leave because they’re so engaged.”
In New Jersey, Apple began partnering with Rutgers University-Newark and 4-H clubs through the 4-H Computer Science Pathways project in 2021. The program uses peer mentors from college and high school to engage young people and build skills in STEM.
“The magic of this program, and of Apple technology, is that the hands-on experience makes our young people realize that they can succeed in STEM fields,” says Rodrigo Sanchez Hernandez, who studied mechanical engineering and now helps run 4-H programming in New Jersey. “When they see someone that looks like them and is close to their age teach these advanced topics in a relatable way, they think, ‘If they can do it, why can’t I?’”
Since 2021, the program has expanded to 4-H clubs throughout the state, including this summer’s STEM Explorers camp in Trenton. Over the course of the month, several dozen students in grades 7 through 9 cycled through iPad-based workshops that included digital media, robotics, coding, and engineering. The digital media week featured a learning lab based on Apple’s Everyone Can Create curriculum that culminated in each student designing a project to bring awareness to environmental issues.
In Michigan, Apple works with Michigan State University and 4-H to help give young people the skills to explore careers in technical and creative disciplines in the Detroit area, as well as in Michigan’s Tribal Nations and communities. This summer, nearly 80 young people, many of whom are affiliated with a tribal nation, attended a 4-H camp in the Hiawatha National Forest, where they used iPad and Apple Pencil to create Keynote presentations on how to build robots.
Back at the Franklin County Fair, the judging had just finished for Calum Williams and his duck. He had been preparing for months — recording his duck’s changing weight in Notes since it hatched, as well as taking photos with the camera on his iPad.
Once all of the competitors had presented their animals, the judge announced the results. Calum had won second place, and the only person that looked happier than he did was his mom, Danielle Moeller Williams.
Moeller Williams was a 4-H club member when she was growing up, and it’s the reason her son joined the organization.
“When I started, there weren’t as many projects to do as there are now,” says Moeller Williams. “I think with all the advancements in technology, there are just so many more opportunities for the kids to get involved. 4-H has showed Calum how to use technology to prepare for his future, and I’m so incredibly proud of how he’s embraced it and the young man he’s become.”

“Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the ultimate sports watch, with features that support athletes at every level of their training and performance — and throughout their day and night,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “The breakthrough insights in watchOS 11 make Apple Watch Ultra 2 even more powerful, and it’s now available in a stunning satin-black titanium finish users will love for its striking look and durability.”
A Stunning New Black Titanium Finish and Accompanying Bands
The new black titanium finish for Apple Watch Ultra 2 is achieved with a custom blasting process, and the diamond-like carbon physical vapor deposition coating over the grade 5 titanium makes it scratch-resistant and durable. The back crystal is made from a matching, dark zirconia.
To complement the new black finish, the popular Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band have all been updated to offer a black hardware option in addition to natural titanium. Both black and natural finishes of Apple Watch Ultra 2 are made from 95 percent recycled titanium, and are carbon neutral with any Titanium Milanese Loop, Trail Loop, or Alpine Loop.
The new Titanium Milanese Loop is the first metal band for Apple Watch Ultra, inspired by mesh historically used by divers and stylish enough for any occasion. Woven from the same aerospace-grade titanium as the case, the band is lightweight and corrosion-resistant. A custom process of weaving, flattening, laser-welding, grinding, and finely polishing the titanium wire results in precise, interlinking lozenge shapes that provide a luxurious drape, complete with a dual-button, parachute-style buckle secure enough for all water sports. The Titanium Milanese Loop will be available in both natural and black titanium.
Enhancements to Support Activity on All Terrains and in the Water
Apple Watch Ultra 2 features the brightest display Apple has ever designed at 3000 nits, suited for a wide range of outdoor adventures. GPS accuracy is also essential for many types of activities. The precision dual-frequency GPS of Apple Watch Ultra 2 utilizes advanced satellite and signal models, custom positioning algorithms, and Apple Maps data to provide the most accurate GPS in a sports watch, leading to more accurate distance, route maps, and metrics.
With watchOS 11, the new Vitals app gives users a way to quickly view key overnight health metrics and gain better context when it comes to their health. The new training load feature offers an insightful new way to measure how the intensity and duration of workouts are impacting a user’s body over time.

This gives users quick access to useful features like Stopwatch, Backtrack, and Flashlight, and a variety of new options, including Translation, Voice Memos, and Shazam.
To help users plan and enjoy open water activities and stay aware of changing conditions, watchOS 11 introduces a new Tides app for Apple Watch. Users can access seven rolling days of forecasted tidal information for coastlines and surf spots around the globe, including information on high and low tides; rising and falling tides; tide height and direction; and sunrise and sunset, all plotted against a timeline. Users can also view beaches near their location on a convenient map, and new complications show current tide information for their favorite spots or the closest beaches at a glance.
Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the best sports watch for athletes and adventurers of all kinds:
With its rugged, corrosion-resistant titanium design, large bright display, and long battery life, Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also great for rowing, skiing, snowboarding, tennis, and many other activities.
Insightful Sleep Apnea Notifications
Sleep apnea is a potentially serious condition where breathing stops momentarily during sleep. The condition, which is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, goes undiagnosed in most cases, and if left untreated, can have important consequences on health. Building on the intelligent health features already available, Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea.3
To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some breathing disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep, and when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. The new sleep apnea algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data so Apple Watch can notify the user if the data indicates signs of sleep apnea. The notification will include the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred, educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, and a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider.
The sleep apnea notification feature was developed with advanced machine learning methods, validated in a clinical study, and is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon. Sleep apnea notifications will be available in more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.
Audio Playback Through Speakers
For the first time, audio can play back through the two built-in speakers on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps — including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and third-party apps — right from their Apple Watch.
Additional watchOS 11 Features
Apple Watch Ultra 2 also features many other enhancements with watchOS 11:
watchOS 11 also features a more intelligentSmart Stackto help users quickly access important information; a newPhotos watch facethat uses machine learning to help users select and compose their best photo options; theTranslate appandCheck Inon Apple Watch; the ability to scroll through any app with thedouble tap gesture;summarized notificationspowered by Apple Intelligence;4and more.
Apple Watch Hermès Ultra 2
The first-of-its-kind Apple Watch Hermès Ultra 2 combines a natural titanium case with the new Hermès En Mer band in Bleu Nuit — a dark navy color — and a special Hermès Maritime watch face. The En Mer band features Hermès’s nautical, diagonal rib pattern made from high-density textured knit, providing both durability and comfort. A wide titanium buckle on the band ensures that Apple Watch Hermès Ultra 2 stays securely on the wrist even during water activities, including scuba diving, sailing, and high-speed water sports.
The new Hermès Maritime watch face features high-visibility numerals in the classic Hermès Cape Cod typeface, with a sweeping outer bezel that displays the seconds. Pressing the Action button transforms the watch face into a special countdown timer inspired by boat racing.

PRESS RELEASE
Introducing Apple Watch Series 10
The world’s bestselling watch is thinner than ever, featuring the biggest, most advanced display yet; sleep apnea notifications; faster charging; and water depth and temperature sensing
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today unveiledApple Watch Series 10, featuring a refined design and bringing new capabilities to the world’s most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. Apple Watch Series 10 is the thinnest Apple Watch yet — making it more comfortable than ever — and offers the biggest, most advanced display of any Apple Watch. It also features new sleep apnea notifications; faster charging; water depth and temperature sensing; plus new health and fitness insights and intelligence in watchOS 11.
Apple Watch Series 10 is available in both aluminum and titanium, in an array of stunning colors and finishes. Jet black is a new polished aluminum finish that is distinctively reflective and sleek, while new titanium cases — available in natural, gold, and slate — have a spectacular jewelry-like shine.
The new Apple Watch lineup can be pre-ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.
“Around the world, Apple Watch has had an immeasurable positive impact on people by helping them stay healthy, active, safe, and connected to the things that matter to them — and it’s helped save countless lives along the way,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Series 10 builds on a decade of breakthrough innovations to offer the most advanced version yet, with even more intelligence, our biggest wearable display, and a design that’s slimmer and sleeker than ever.”
The Sleekest, Thinnest Apple Watch Yet
Apple Watch Series 10 is nearly 10 percent thinner than Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Series 9, while offering all the advanced capabilities users love, adding new features, and maintaining all-day 18-hour battery life. An innovative metal back integrates the antenna into the housing of the device itself, combining the two layers into one. The back is perfectly matched in material, finish, and color to the rest of the case, making it appear like the device is made from a single piece of metal.
The new S10 SiP was engineered to achieve a thinner profile, and designed for performance, power efficiency, and intelligence. The S10 SiP and built-in 4-core Neural Engine allow for intelligent features users rely on every day, including the double tap gesture, on-device Siri, dictation, and automatic workout detection; important safety features such as Crash Detection and Fall Detection; and the updated Smart Stack, the redesigned Photos face, and the Translate app in watchOS 11.
In addition to being thinner, Apple Watch Series 10 is also lighter: Aluminum cases weigh up to 10 percent less than Series 9, and titanium cases weigh almost 20 percent less than stainless steel Series 9. The case also features more rounded corners and a wider aspect ratio, which contribute to a much larger display while only slightly growing the case to new 42mm and 46mm sizes.
Apple’s Largest, Most Advanced Wearable Display
The display on Apple Watch is central to every interaction, from viewing a notification, to taking a quick glance at workout metrics. Apple Watch Series 10 features the biggest and most advanced display of any Apple Watch.
The larger display offers up to 30 percent more active screen area than Apple Watch Series 4, Series 5, and Series 6, and up to 9 percent more than Apple Watch Series 7, Series 8, and Series 9. This improves readability and usability: In apps like Messages, Mail, or News, users can see an additional line of text or increase the font size without sacrificing content. The larger display also makes it easier to type a message, pause a workout, or enter a passcode.
Apple Watch Series 10 is the first Apple product to offer an innovative wide-angle OLED display, which optimizes each pixel to emit more light at wider angles. As a result, the display is up to 40 percent brighter than Series 9 when viewed from an angle, making it easier to read at a glance.
The wide-angle OLED display is also more power efficient, enabling a faster refresh rate when Apple Watch is in always-on mode, going from once a minute to once a second. As a result, users can now see a ticking seconds hand without raising their wrist on select watch faces.
New watch faces in watchOS 11 are designed to take advantage of the bigger display and faster refresh rate on Apple Watch Series 10. The Flux watch face features a bold graphic design that fills the screen with color second by second. The Reflections watch face features a distinctive shimmering dial that reacts subtly to user movements, and is designed to complement the highly reflective quality of the new titanium cases.
Faster Charging
The new metal back integrates a larger and more efficient charging coil, making Series 10 the fastest-charging Apple Watch ever, so it is easier than ever to use Apple Watch throughout the day as well as overnight. Fifteen minutes of charging provides up to eight hours of normal daily use, or eight minutes of charging powers up to eight hours of sleep tracking. Faster charging also means users can charge to 80 percent battery in about 30 minutes.
Insightful Sleep Apnea Notifications
The compact new design and faster charging of Apple Watch Series 10 make it even more comfortable and convenient to wear during sleep. Building on the intelligent health features already available to track key overnight metrics such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature, Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea.1
Sleep apnea is a potentially serious condition where breathing stops repeatedly during sleep.The condition, which is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, goes undiagnosed in most cases. If left untreated, sleep apnea can have important consequences on health, including an increased risk of hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.
To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some of these disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep and, when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.
The new sleep apnea algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data, so Apple Watch can notify a user if the data indicates consistent signs of sleep apnea. The notification will include the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred and educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, along with a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data, notification details, and additional information to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider.
The sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning and an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The feature was then validated in a clinical study — unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology. In the clinical validation study, every participant identified by the algorithm had at least mild sleep apnea. The feature is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon. Sleep apnea notifications will be available in more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.
Depth and Temperature Sensing for Water Activities, and the New Tides App
Apple Watch is great for activities in and around the water, with a swim-proof design that has a 50-meter water resistance rating, automatic stroke detection, and lap counting — and now watchOS 11 introduces Custom Workouts for pool swims. A new depth gauge and water temperature sensor make Apple Watch Series 10 an even better companion when users are headed into the water.
The new depth gauge can measure down to 6 meters beneath the water’s surface, perfect for snorkeling and shallow diving, or playing in the pool, lake, or ocean. Additionally, the new water temperature sensor measures the temperature of the water once Apple Watch has been submerged. The built-in Depth app is highly legible for easy underwater visibility, displaying the time, current depth, water temperature, duration under water, and maximum depth — with the option to automatically activate as soon as Apple Watch is submerged. Water temperature is also displayed in workout metrics during Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts.
To help users plan and enjoy open water activities and stay aware of changing conditions, watchOS 11 introduces a new Tides app. Users can access seven rolling days of forecasted tidal information for coastlines and surf spots around the globe, including information on high and low tides, rising and falling tides, tide height and direction, and sunrise and sunset, all plotted against a timeline. Users can also view beaches near their location on a convenient map, and new complications show current tide information for their favorite spots or closest beaches at a glance.
The Oceanic+ app is now available for Apple Watch Series 10, with new features for snorkeling.2Developed in partnership with Huish Outdoors, the app allows users to easily find popular snorkeling locations nearby; view information on conditions provided by the snorkeling community; and during a snorkeling session, see depth, water temperature, and more in a single view.
Audio Playback Through Speakers and Voice Isolation for Calls
Audio can now be played back through the built-in speaker on Apple Watch Series 10. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps — including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books, and third-party apps — right from their Apple Watch.
Apple Watch Series 10 also uses a new voice isolation neural network running on the 4-core Neural Engine to suppress background noise during phone or FaceTime audio calls, so a user’s voice sounds crisp and clear on the other end of the line — even in noisy environments like a crowded restaurant, a city street, or a windy day outside.
Sophisticated New Aluminum Finishes and Polished Titanium
For the first time, Apple Watch is available in a polished aluminum finish, jet black, with a distinctively glossy, reflective shine. To achieve this, the aluminum case is polished using nano-particles and then undergoes a 30-step anodization process. Apple Watch Series 10 also comes in an updated rose gold aluminum, along with the popular brushed silver aluminum.
Additionally, Apple Watch Series 10 is available in an aerospace-grade polished titanium that replaces the stainless steel of previous generations. The new grade 5 titanium cases offer a spectacularly reflective, jewelry-like finish, while being almost 20 percent lighter than Apple Watch Series 9 in stainless steel. The titanium cases come in three stunning colors: natural, gold, and slate.
Last year, Apple Watch became Apple’s first carbon neutral product by dramatically reducing carbon emissions across the three biggest sources — materials, electricity, and transportation — and using high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects to offset the small amount of emissions remaining. With the introduction of Apple Watch Series 10, made with 100 percent recycled aluminum or 95 percent recycled titanium in the case, customers now can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch in any material. This is an important step toward Apple 2030, Apple’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by 2030.
Featuring watchOS 11
In addition to the new Tides app, Apple Watch Series 10 features the powerful health and fitness insights and intelligent customization that come with watchOS 11, including:
watchOS 11 also features a more intelligentSmart Stackto help users quickly access important information, a redesignedPhotos facethat uses machine learning to help users curate their best photo options, theTranslate appandCheck Inon Apple Watch, the ability to scroll through any app with thedouble tap gesture,summarized notificationspowered by Apple Intelligence forwarded from iPhone,3and more.
Lineup
Bands
The Milanese Loop and Link Bracelet bands have been updated to perfectly color-match the new titanium cases of Apple Watch Series 10.
A new collection of Hermès bands draws on the house’s rich history in textiles and craftsmanship. Torsade is a cable-knit band inspired by nautical chains available in single and double tour versions in one of three bold colors. Twill Jump Attelage is a narrow, delicate single tour band with a contrasting edge and silky feel. Grand H is Hermès’s first metal band for Apple Watch, made with interlocking links of satin-finished stainless steel. It features two H-shaped links, removable links customers can use to adjust the size, and a traditional double butterfly closure.
Additionally, the Nike Sport Loop and Nike Sport Band are available in bold new colorways.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces groundbreaking health features to support conditions impacting billions of people
Apple Watch delivers new sleep apnea notifications, and AirPods Pro 2 provide the world’s first all-in-one hearing health experience including a clinical-grade, over-the-counter Hearing Aid feature
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today unveiled breakthrough sleep and hearing health features coming toApple WatchandAirPods Pro 2that further deliver on Apple’s commitment to health with experiences that enrich users’ lives. These new features expand across products, bringing informative and powerful ways to support users in their sleep and hearing health for conditions that impact billions globally.
Using an innovative new Breathing Disturbances metric, sleep apnea notifications come to Apple Watch, adding to the many ways Apple Watch acts as an intelligent guardian for users’ health. The sleep apnea notifications are expected to receive marketing authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other global health authorities soon, with availability this month in more than 150 countries and regions, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.1
Apple is providing the world’s first all-in-one hearing health experience with AirPods Pro with active Hearing Protection,2a clinically validated Hearing Test feature, and an over-the-counter Hearing Aid feature. The first-of-its-kind software-based Hearing Aid feature helps make access to hearing assistance easier than ever at an approachable price point. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are expected to receive marketing authorization from global health authorities soon, and will be available this fall in more than 100 countries and regions, including the U.S., Germany, and Japan.3
“At Apple, we believe that technology can help you live a healthier life, and we’re excited to enable incredible new health capabilities for serious conditions that affect billions of people around the world, while continuing to keep user data private,” said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health. “With Apple Watch, we continue to offer our users the ability to uncover important health conditions with new sleep apnea notifications. And on AirPods Pro, powerful features put users’ hearing health front and center, bringing new ways to help test for and receive assistance for hearing loss.”
A Powerful Way to Detect Signs of Sleep Apnea
Sleep is an important area of health as it impacts a person’s overall physical and mental wellbeing. Sleep apnea is a prevalent disorder in which breathing momentarily stops during sleep, preventing the body from getting enough oxygen. The condition is estimated to impact more than 1 billion people worldwide, and in most cases, goes undiagnosed. If left untreated, it can have important health consequences over time, including increased risk of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiac issues.
Breathing Disturbances is an innovative new Apple Watch metric that uses the accelerometer to detect small movements at the wrist associated with interruptions to normal respiratory patterns during sleep. Every 30 days, Apple Watch will analyze breathing disturbance data and notify users if it shows consistent signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea so they can speak to their doctor about next steps, including potential diagnosis and treatment.
Because overall quality of sleep is important, Breathing Disturbances can also be used to assess restfulness of sleep. Breathing Disturbances can be influenced by alcohol, medications, sleep position, and more. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.
For more informed conversations with their healthcare providers, users can export a PDF that shows when sleep apnea may have occurred, three months of breathing disturbance data, and additional information. Educational articles are also available within the Health app to help users learn more about sleep apnea.
The sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning and an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The feature was then validated in a clinical study — unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology. In the clinical validation study, every participant identified by the algorithm had at least mild sleep apnea.
“Empowering consumers everywhere to have the ability to reliably identify the presence of abnormal breathing patterns during sleep can help uncover a woefully underdiagnosed and serious medical condition such as sleep apnea,” said Sairam Parthasarathy, M.D., University of Arizona Health Sciences Center for Sleep, Circadian, and Neurosciences’s professor and director in Tucson, Arizona. “This is a major step forward in improving public health.”
Sleep apnea notifications and Breathing Disturbances add to a range of sleep health features for Apple Watch users. In addition to monitoring important overnight health metrics like heart rate and respiratory rate, Apple Watch also helps users meet their sleep goals and track their sleep over time.
The World’s First All-in-One Hearing Health Experience
Approximately 1.5 billion people around the world are living with hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. Research has also identified links between hearing loss and impact on a person’s overall wellbeing, including dementia and social isolation.
To help users better understand their hearing health, Apple is introducing an end-to-end experience focused on prevention, awareness, and assistance.
Prevention
According to the Apple Hearing Study — a longitudinal, virtual public research study conducted in collaboration with the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the World Health Organization — one in three people are regularly exposed to loud environmental noise levels that can impact their hearing. That can include common scenarios like taking the subway while commuting, mowing the lawn at home, attending a sporting event, and many more.
In order to help users prevent exposure to loud environmental noise while preserving the sound signature of what they’re listening to, Hearing Protection comes to AirPods Pro. The ear tips help to provide passive noise reduction, while the H2 chip helps to actively reduce louder, more intermittent noise at 48,000 times per second. On by default across all listening modes, Hearing Protection is helpful in a variety of loud settings. Plus, with an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm, sounds at live events like concerts remain natural and vibrant.
Awareness
Hearing loss often worsens gradually, leaving many people unaware that they may be living with the condition. Eighty percent of adults in the U.S. have not had their hearing checked in the last five years, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. To give users even more insights into hearing health, Apple is introducing an intuitive, clinical-grade hearing test based on the standard clinical approach called pure-tone audiometry that users can take themselves with their AirPods Pro and a compatible iPhone or iPad.
Users can take the convenient test in about five minutes from the comfort of their own home. The Hearing Test feature leverages advanced acoustic science and provides users with an interactive experience. When a user completes the test, they will see an easy-to-understand summary of their results, including a number representing hearing loss in each ear, a classification, and recommendations. The results, which include an audiogram, are stored privately and securely in the Health app, and can be shared with a healthcare provider to have more informed conversations.
The Hearing Test builds on learnings from the Apple Hearing Study and was developed using large-scale, real-world data. The feature was then validated against the clinical gold standard of pure-tone audiometry.
“Hearing health is a cornerstone of overall wellbeing. Protecting and preserving our hearing enhances our quality of life both in the short-term and long-term,” said Rick Neitzel, University of Michigan School of Public Health’s professor of Environmental Health Sciences and principal investigator of the Apple Hearing Study. “I’m thrilled Apple is introducing important tools to support people’s hearing health. These tools will help people protect their ears from noise pollution, be aware of changes in their hearing over time, and have important conversations with their healthcare providers when they need additional support.”
Assistance
Learning about hearing loss is a critical step to getting necessary assistance, which can often be challenging due to cost and access. Global research shows hearing loss often goes untreated. In fact, the Apple Hearing Study revealed that 75 percent of people diagnosed with hearing loss haven’t received the assistive support that they need.
AirPods Pro add an innovative over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. Using the personalized hearing profile from the Hearing Test, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid. After setup, the feature enables personalized dynamic adjustments so users have the sounds around them boosted in real time. This helps them better engage in conversation, and keeps them connected to the people and environment around them. With the incredible audio quality of AirPods Pro, the user’s personalized hearing profile is automatically applied to music, movies, games, and phone calls across their devices, without needing to adjust any settings. Users can also set up the Hearing Aid feature with an audiogram created by a hearing health professional.
The Hearing Aid feature was clinically validated in a controlled, randomized study that evaluated the perceived benefit of the feature and its custom settings compared to an audiologist-assisted setup.
After taking the Hearing Test, the user’s hearing profile can also help to personalize the AirPods Pro listening experience for even more people, including those with little to no hearing loss who can still benefit from specific adjustments at individual frequencies. To help provide the best listening experience, Media Assist is an all-new feature that helps boost certain parts of speech on a phone call or instruments within a soundtrack to help an even broader population.
These features build on the hearing health tools Apple currently offers its users. For example, with the Noise app, Apple Watch users can enable notifications for when environmental noise levels might affect their hearing health. On iPhone, users can set a headphone volume limit where they can turn on Reduce Loud Audio and drag a slider to a preferred decibel level. Apple also offers additional accessibility features for users to customize settings to meet their hearing needs.
“For decades, Apple has led the way in designing products for everyone and supporting users with a broad spectrum of hearing abilities,” said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. “These features on AirPods Pro will make an impact on so many people by driving more awareness around hearing health and empowering individuals with new customizable tools to help them stay connected.”
Additional features coming to Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad include:
Since launching the Health app in 2014, Apple has introduced meaningful features that focus on 18 areas of health and fitness across Apple Watch, AirPods, iPhone, and iPad. Apple is committed to empowering users on their health journey by building actionable features into the products they use every day that are grounded in science, and have privacy at the core.
Built with Privacy at the Core
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s health features. When a user’s device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.

This fall,AirPods Pro 2will introduce the world’s first end-to-endhearing health experience, delivering active Hearing Protection,1a scientifically validated Hearing Test, and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature.2
AirPods 4 and AirPods Max will be available to pre-order starting today, with availability in stores beginning Friday, September 20. New hearing health features will be available this fall for AirPods Pro 2 users in more than 100 countries and regions.
“With AirPods 4, customers can enjoy Active Noise Cancellation and the most advanced audio experience ever in an open-ear design,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “And with a revolutionary update to the world’s best-selling headphones, AirPods Pro will deliver groundbreaking new capabilities — including Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features — to help more than a billion people affected by hearing loss.”
AirPods 4 Unveil an Industry-Defining Design
With incredible sound quality, up to 24-hour battery life with the charging case, and an iconic design, the original AirPods offered wireless convenience and seamless pairing with the Apple ecosystem of products. That experience gets even better with AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with ANC, offering a brand-new fit and an array of powerful features and capabilities.
AirPods 4 are the best headphones Apple has ever created with an open-ear design, setting an entirely new benchmark for fit and comfort. The new design is built with an unparalleled data set that uses advanced modeling tools, like 3D photogrammetry and laser topography, to precisely map and analyze thousands of ear shapes and over 50 million individual data points in total. This process helped refine the design to deliver the most comfortable AirPods ever with one shape that naturally fits even more users around the world.
Delivering a massive improvement in sound quality, AirPods 4 feature an entirely new acoustic architecture, low-distortion driver, and high dynamic range amplifier, and add Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking for the most immersive media experience. With the H2 chip, AirPods 4 unlock intelligent audio experiences only Apple silicon can deliver, such as Voice Isolation, enabling clearer call quality no matter the environmental conditions, and Siri Interactions, allowing users to simply nod their head yes or gently shake their head no to respond to Siri announcements. For even more control, AirPods 4 also feature a new force sensor on the stem to play or pause media and mute or end calls with a quick press. Thanks to the H2 chip, AirPods 4 are also great for gaming, delivering low wireless audio latency and excellent voice quality when chatting with teammates and other players, including support for 16-bit, 48kHz audio.
For additional convenience, the charging case now offers USB-C charging and is more than 10 percent smaller in volume than its predecessor — all while still delivering up to 30 hours of battery life.3In addition to a USB-C charging cable, customers that choose AirPods 4 with ANC can charge using an Apple Watch charger or Qi-certified charger, and at just 50mm wide, the charging case is the smallest in the industry with wireless charging capabilities.
AirPods 4 Bring ANC to an Open-Ear Fit
For the first time, AirPods 4 bring ANC to an open-ear design with an additional model. With upgraded microphones, the power of the H2 chip, and advanced computational audio, AirPods 4 with ANC help to reduce environmental noise like airplane engines, city traffic, and more. Working across hardware and software to deliver the most natural listening experience, AirPods 4 with ANC also introduce intelligent features like Transparency mode to keep users aware of their environment; Adaptive Audio, which dynamically blends Transparency mode and ANC based on the conditions of a user’s environment; and Conversation Awareness, which lowers the user’s media volume when they start speaking to someone nearby.
AirPods Max Get Five New Colors
AirPods Max are available in five beautiful new colors, including midnight, starlight, blue, orange, and purple, and offer complementary finishes alongside other Apple products like Mac and iPad. Additionally, AirPods Max now feature USB-C charging capabilities, making them more convenient than ever to charge at home or on the go.
AirPods Pro 2 Introduce the World’s First All-in-One Hearing Health Experience
Approximately 1.5 billion people around the world are living with hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization. Building on years of work in hearing health — including the Noise app on Apple Watch, headphone audio levels with iPhone, hearing accessibility features, and the Apple Hearing Study — Apple is introducing an end-to-end experience focused on prevention, awareness, and assistance.
Prevention
According to the Apple Hearing Study, one in three people are regularly exposed to loud environmental noise levels that can impact their hearing. That can include common scenarios like taking the subway while commuting, mowing the lawn at home, attending a sporting event, and many more. In order to help users prevent exposure to loud environmental noise while preserving the sound signature of what they’re listening to, Hearing Protection comes to AirPods Pro. The ear tips help to provide passive noise reduction, while the H2 chip helps to actively reduce louder, more intermittent noise at 48,000 times per second. On by default across all listening modes, Hearing Protection is helpful in a variety of loud settings. Plus, with an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm, sounds at live events like concerts remain natural and vibrant so users don’t miss a beat.
Awareness
Apple is also introducing a scientifically validated Hearing Test feature with AirPods Pro and a compatible iPhone or iPad, expanding the ability for users to quickly check their hearing from the comfort of their home in minutes. The test is simple to take, utilizes a standard clinical approach called pure-tone audiometry, leverages advanced acoustic science, and provides users with an interactive experience. When a user completes the test, they will see an easy-to-understand summary of their results in a personalized hearing profile for AirPods Pro, which is stored privately and securely in their Health app. Users can also share these results with their healthcare providers for more informed conversations.
Assistance
“Hearing health is an essential part of our overall wellbeing, yet it can often be overlooked — in fact, according to the Apple Hearing Study, a staggering 75 percent of people diagnosed with hearing loss go untreated,” said Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health. “We’re thrilled to provide breakthrough software features with AirPods Pro that put users’ hearing health front and center, bringing new ways to help test for and receive assistance for hearing loss.”
AirPods Pro also add an innovative, over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with mild to moderate hearing loss. Using the personalized hearing profile from the Hearing Test, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a clinical-grade hearing aid. After setup, the feature enables personalized dynamic adjustments so users have the sounds around them boosted in real time. This helps users better engage in conversation and keeps them connected to the people and environment around them. With the incredible audio quality of AirPods Pro, the user’s personalized hearing profile is automatically applied to music, movies, games, and phone calls across their devices without needing to adjust any settings. This first-of-its-kind software-based Hearing Aid feature brings users the ability to fine-tune their experience at any time, making access to hearing assistance easier than ever at an approachable price point. Users can also set up the Hearing Aid feature with an audiogram created by a hearing health professional. Both the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are grounded in science and were validated through rigorous scientific studies. The Hearing Test and Hearing Aid features are expected to receive marketing authorization from global health authorities soon, and will be available this fall in more than 100 countries and regions, including the United States, Germany, and Japan.
After taking the Hearing Test, users can also use their hearing profile to personalize the AirPods Pro listening experience. This benefits even more people, including those with little to no hearing loss, who can take advantage of specific adjustments at individual frequencies. To help provide the best listening experience, Media Assist is an all-new feature that helps boost certain parts of speech on a phone call or instruments within a soundtrack to help an even broader population.
Better for the Environment
AirPods are designed to minimize their impact on the environment. The new AirPods 4 design includes the use of 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. The case also uses 100 percent recycled tin in the solder of the main logic board and 100 percent recycled aluminum in the hinge. AirPods 4 are free of potentially harmful substances such as mercury, BFRs, and PVC. In a first for AirPods, 100 percent of the packaging is made using fiber-based materials, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from all packaging by 2025. Additionally, Apple reduced the packaging volume by more than 30 percent compared to the previous generation, which helps decrease emissions from shipping and move closer to Apple’s commitment of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple introduces iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus
Built for Apple Intelligence with the all-new A18 chip, both models feature Camera Control, powerful upgrades to the advanced camera system, the Action button to quickly access useful features, and a big boost in battery life
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announcediPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, built for Apple Intelligence, the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant while protecting user privacy. The iPhone 16 lineup also introduces Camera Control, which brings new ways to capture memories, and will help users quickly access visual intelligence to learn about objects or places around them faster than ever before. The powerful camera system features a 48MP Fusion camera with a 2x Telephoto option, giving users two cameras in one, while a new Ultra Wide camera enables macro photography. Next-generation Photographic Styles help users personalize their images, and spatial photo and video capture allows users to relive life’s precious memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro. The new A18 chip delivers a huge leap in performance and efficiency, enabling demanding AAA games, as well as a big boost in battery life.
iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will be available in five bold colors: black, white, pink, teal, and ultramarine. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 13, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.
“iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus mark the beginning of a new era for iPhone with Apple Intelligence delivering powerful, personal, and private experiences to our users,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “With new ways to discover the world around you and capture memories using Camera Control; a 48MP Fusion camera that gives you two optical-quality cameras in one; a big boost in battery life; and powerful, efficient performance thanks to the A18 chip, this is the perfect time for customers to upgrade or make the switch to iPhone.”
Built for Apple Intelligence
Apple Intelligenceon the iPhone 16 lineup harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Apple Intelligence maintains the privacy and security of user data with Private Cloud Compute. This groundbreaking approach provides the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers — an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update, with the first set of features rolling out next month in U.S. English for most regions around the world.
Apple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing. With systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, users can rewrite, proofread, and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. In the Notes and Phone apps, users can also record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to recall key points.
Apple Intelligence helps users prioritize with summarized notifications, along with Priority Messages in Mail, a feature that understands the content of emails and surfaces time-sensitive messages. Across a user’s inbox, summaries convey the most important information of each email instead of previewing the first few lines.
Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. With richer language-understanding capabilities, communicating with Siri is more natural and flexible. Siri follows along when users stumble over their words, and maintains context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and switch fluidly between text and voice as they accelerate everyday tasks. Siri also now has extensive product knowledge to answer thousands of questions about features on iPhone and other Apple devices.
Additional Apple Intelligence features will roll out later this year and in the months following, including Image Playground, which allows users to create playful images in moments. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member. Siri will be able to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness to understand and take action with users’ content, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. And while using iOS 18 features like Siri and Writing Tools, users will also be able to easily access ChatGPT from OpenAI.
A Beautiful New Design with Industry-Leading Durability
iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are beautiful and built to last. iPhone holds its value longer than any other smartphone thanks to its industry-leading durability, including the strong back glass, a water- and dust-resistant design, regular software updates, and the latest-generation Ceramic Shield with an advanced formulation that is 50 percent tougher than the first generation and 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone.1The internal design of iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus has been reengineered to allow for an even larger battery and to better dissipate heat, while making battery service easier. With the new internal design and advanced power management ofiOS 18, the batteries are optimized to offer a big boost in battery life. Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes, the Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology and the Dynamic Island offers an exceptional viewing experience.2
The Action button comes to iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Users can quickly open the camera, flashlight, or controls; switch between Ring and Silent; recognize music with Shazam; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can also access in-app functionality, like helping a user unlock and lock their car with FordPass.3
Introducing Camera Control
Camera Control — a result of thoughtful hardware and software integration — elevates the camera experience on the iPhone 16 lineup. It is packed with innovation, including a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. Camera Control can quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording so users don’t miss the moment. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options — such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field — to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. Additionally, developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Snapchat.
Later this year, Camera Control will unlock visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more. Camera Control will also serve as a gateway into third-party tools with specific domain expertise, like when users want to search on Google to find where they can buy an item, or to benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.
New Camera Experiences
The powerful new camera system helps users capture both everyday moments and cherished memories like never before. The 48MP Fusion camera enables a 2x optical-quality Telephoto option, which is like having two cameras in one, so users can get closer to the subject to easily frame a photo. In addition to wider-angle shots, the new 12MP Ultra Wide camera with autofocus enables macro photography. The Ultra Wide camera also gathers up to 2.6x more light for higher image quality. Additionally, iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus now take spatial photos and videos to help users relive memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro.
Next-generation Photographic Styles help users express their creativity and customize their photos by locally adjusting color, highlights, and shadows in real time. Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalize how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a color to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colors of a selected style. A wider set of styles offers more creative options for editing a photo’s aesthetic, and styles can be rendered during live preview, applied after a photo is taken, or even reversed later.
Video can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system. Both iPhone models introduce creative new ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix — allowing users to adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.
Powered by Apple Intelligence, users can search for specific photos in the Photos app using natural language, and search for specific moments in video clips. Additionally, the new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject.
A18: Next-Level Performance and Mobile Gaming
A18 delivers a huge leap in performance and power efficiency, and is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology to further accelerate Apple Intelligence. An upgraded 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs ML models up to 2x faster than the A16 Bionic chip.
The 6-core CPU is 30 percent faster than the A16 Bionic chip and faster than all the competition. It is also more power efficient and can run the same workload with 30 percent less power than A16 Bionic. The 5-core GPU is up to 40 percent faster and 35 percent more efficient than A16 Bionic to power stunning graphics performance for Apple Intelligence, and puts a powerful gaming device in users’ pockets. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, games on iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus more accurately represent the behavior of light with up to 5x higher frame rates than with software-based ray tracing. Both models support the AAA games previously only available on iPhone 15 Pro, as well as new titles like Honor of Kings: World with an ultra graphics mode optimized for the iPhone 16 lineup, coming next year. Game Mode in iOS 18 delivers more consistent frame rates while making AirPods, game controllers, and other wireless accessories incredibly responsive. The efficiency of A18 and the device’s rearchitected internal design deliver up to 30 percent higher sustained performance for gaming while ensuring Apple Intelligence runs efficiently on iPhone.
Expanded Communication and Safety Capabilities
The iPhone 16 lineup features innovative ways to stay connected and provides enhanced safety capabilities for peace of mind. Powered by the same groundbreaking technology as Emergency SOS via satellite, users are able to connect to the nearest satellite to send and receive texts, emoji, and Tapbacks over iMessage and SMS while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.4Messages via satellite in iOS 18 are end-to-end encrypted. Also new with iOS 18, Emergency SOS Live Video allows users to share a live video feed or photos with participating emergency dispatchers during an emergency call.5Later this fall, Roadside Assistance via satellite — which connects users to a roadside assistance provider if they have car trouble while off the grid — expands beyond the U.S. to the U.K.
Better for the Environment
iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is prioritizing renewable electricity in manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including the iPhone 16 lineup. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
To achieve Apple 2030, the company is also designing products with recycled and renewable materials. iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus feature more than 30 percent recycled content overall, including 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure and 80 percent or more recycled steel across multiple components. The battery is made with 100 percent recycled cobalt and — in a first for iPhone — over 95 percent recycled lithium.6The iPhone 16 lineup meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury and PVC. The packaging is entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by next year.

UPDATE
Apple Intelligence comes to iPhone, iPad, and Mac starting next month
Helpful Writing Tools, Mail and notifications summaries, a more natural and flexible Siri, the Clean Up tool in Photos, and many more Apple Intelligence features roll out in the U.S., with additional English-language support coming later this year
Today, Apple announced thatApple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant, will start rolling out next month with iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, with more features launching in the coming months. In addition, Apple introduced the new iPhone 16 lineup, built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence and featuring the faster, more efficient A18 and A18 Pro chips — making these the most advanced and capable iPhone models ever.
Apple Intelligence first launches in U.S. English, and will quickly expand to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December. Over the course of the next year, Apple Intelligence will expand to more languages, like Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Vietnamese, and others.
Getting Started with Apple Intelligence
Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, harnessing the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks — all while protecting users’ privacy and security. Many of the models that power Apple Intelligence run entirely on device, and Private Cloud Compute offers the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers. The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available next month, delivering experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them.
With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. In addition, natural language can be used to search for specific photos, and search in videos gets more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips. The new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.
In the Notes and Phone apps, users can record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence also generates a summary to help recall key points.
Apple Intelligence helps users prioritize and stay in the moment with summarized notifications across apps, Reduce Interruptions — a new Focus that surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention — as well as Priority Messages in Mail, which understands the content of emails and surfaces time-sensitive messages. Across a user’s inbox, summaries convey the most important information of each email instead of simply previewing the first few lines. Smart Reply in Mail provides users with suggestions for a quick response and identifies questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.
Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience. It has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPhone, iPad, or CarPlay. On Mac, a user can place Siri anywhere on their desktop to access it easily as they work. Users can type to Siri at any time on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and can maintain context from one request to the next. In addition, with Siri’s extensive product knowledge, it can now answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple devices. Users can learn everything from how to take a screen recording to how to easily share a Wi-Fi password.
Many More Features to Come
More Apple Intelligence features will roll out later this year and in the months following. Image Playground will allow users to create playful images in moments. Image Wand will make notes more visually engaging by turning rough sketches into delightful images. When a user circles an empty space, Image Wand will create an image using context from the surrounding area. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member. Siri will be even more capable, with the ability to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. Plus, users have the option to access ChatGPT’s broad world knowledge from several experiences within iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between tools.
An Extraordinary Step Forward for Privacy in AI
Apple Intelligence is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. Private Cloud Compute marks a fundamental breakthrough in server-based intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to continuously verify this privacy promise and are already doing so.
In addition, for users who choose to access ChatGPT through Siri or Writing Tools, privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won’t store requests. Users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and ChatGPT’s data-use policies apply for those who choose to connect their account.
Availability
Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update. The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in beta next month as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, with more features rolling out in the months to come. It will be available on iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with device and Siri language set to U.S. English. Additional languages and platforms are coming over the course of the next year.

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today introducediPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, featuring Apple Intelligence, larger display sizes, new creative capabilities with innovative pro camera features, stunning graphics for immersive gaming, and more — all powered by the A18 Pro chip. With Apple Intelligence, powerful Apple-built generative models come to iPhone in the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that understands personal context to deliver intelligence that is helpful and relevant while protecting user privacy. Camera Control unlocks a fast, intuitive way to tap into visual intelligence and easily interact with the advanced camera system. Featuring a new 48MP Fusion camera with a faster quad-pixel sensor that enables 4K120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision, these new Pro models achieve the highest resolution and frame-rate combination ever available on iPhone. Additional advancements include a new 48MP Ultra Wide camera for higher-resolution photography, including macro; a 5x Telephoto camera on both Pro models; and studio-quality mics to record more true-to-life audio. The durable titanium design is strong yet lightweight, with larger display sizes, the thinnest borders on any Apple product, and a huge leap in battery life — with iPhone 16 Pro Max offering the best battery life on iPhone ever.
iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available in four stunning finishes: black titanium, natural titanium, white titanium, and desert titanium. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 13, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.
“Powered by the faster, more efficient A18 Pro chip and built for Apple Intelligence, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are the most advanced iPhone models we’ve ever made,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing. “Customers who are looking for the best possible iPhone will be able to take advantage of this huge step forward, whether they’re applying edits to a photo without lifting a finger, rewriting meeting notes for a more professional tone, or using the advanced camera system to capture their next masterpiece in 4K120 fps in Dolby Vision — all while enjoying extraordinary battery life.”
Built for Apple Intelligence
Apple Intelligenceon the iPhone 16 lineup harnesses the power of Apple silicon and Apple-built generative models to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Apple Intelligence maintains the privacy and security of user data with Private Cloud Compute. This groundbreaking approach provides the ability to flex and scale computational capacity between on-device processing and larger, server-based models that run on dedicated Apple silicon servers — an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence. Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update, with the first set of features rolling out next month in U.S. English for most regions around the world.
With systemwide Writing Tools, users can adjust notes or emails to be more friendly, more concise, or add a more professional tone to their writing; check for grammar, word choice, and sentence structure; and summarize selected text to make it more digestible. In the Notes and Phone apps, users can also record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to recall key points.
Apple Intelligence helps users prioritize with summarized notifications, along with Priority Messages in Mail, a feature that understands the content of emails and surfaces time-sensitive messages. Across a user’s inbox, summaries convey the most important information of each email instead of previewing the first few lines.
Siri becomes more deeply integrated into the system experience and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active. With richer language-understanding capabilities, communicating with Siri is more natural and flexible. Siri follows along when users stumble over their words, and maintains context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and switch fluidly between text and voice as they accelerate everyday tasks. Siri also now has extensive product knowledge to answer thousands of questions about features on iPhone and other Apple devices.
Additional Apple Intelligence features will roll out later this year and in the months following, including Image Playground, which allows users to create playful images in moments. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji by simply typing a description, or by selecting a photo of a friend or family member. Siri will be able to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. It will also gain onscreen awareness to understand and take action with users’ content, as well as take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. And while using iOS 18 features like Siri and Writing Tools, users will be able to easily access ChatGPT from OpenAI.
An Incredibly Light and Durable Design with Larger Displays
The new Pro lineup features the thinnest borders of any Apple product and introduces larger display sizes: 6.3 inches on iPhone 16 Pro and 6.9 inches on iPhone 16 Pro Max — the largest iPhone display ever.1The stunning Super Retina XDR displays with Always-On and ProMotion technologies help users accomplish more. Both models offer industry-leading durability with a strong, lightweight titanium design, as well as the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The new mechanical architecture improves heat dissipation and efficiency for up to 20 percent better sustained performance. Along with the new internal design and advanced power management ofiOS 18, larger batteries are optimized to offer a huge leap in battery life.
Introducing Camera Control
Camera Control — a result of thoughtful hardware and software integration — makes the pro camera system more versatile with an innovative new way to quickly launch the camera, take a photo, and start video recording. It has a tactile switch that powers the click experience, a high-precision force sensor that enables the light press gesture, and a capacitive sensor that allows for touch interactions. A new camera preview helps users frame the shot and adjust other control options — such as zoom, exposure, or depth of field — to compose a stunning photo or video by sliding their finger on the Camera Control. Later this fall, Camera Control will be updated with a two-stage shutter to automatically lock focus and exposure on a subject with a light press, letting users reframe the shot without losing focus. Additionally, developers will be able to bring Camera Control to third-party apps such as Kino, which will offer users the ability to adjust white balance and set focus points, including at various levels of depth in their scene.
Later this year, Camera Control will unlock visual intelligence to help users learn about objects and places faster than ever before. Users can click and hold Camera Control to pull up the hours or ratings for a restaurant they pass, add an event from a flyer to their calendar, quickly identify a dog by breed, and more. Camera Control will also serve as a gateway into third-party tools with specific domain expertise, like when users want to search on Google to find where they can buy an item, or to benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.
New Pro Creativity Across Photo, Video, and Audio
With iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the world’s favorite camera gets even more powerful. Powered by A18 Pro, the upgraded camera system introduces a new 48MP Fusion camera with a faster, more efficient quad-pixel sensor and Apple Camera Interface, unlocking 4K120 fps video recording in Dolby Vision — the highest resolution and frame-rate combination ever available on iPhone, and a smartphone first. The quad-pixel sensor can read data 2x faster, enabling zero shutter lag for 48MP ProRAW or HEIF photos. A new 48MP Ultra Wide camera also features a quad-pixel sensor with autofocus, so users can take higher-resolution 48MP ProRAW and HEIF images when capturing uniquely framed, wider-angle shots or getting close to their subjects with macro photography. The powerful 5x Telephoto camera now comes on both iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, allowing users to catch the action from farther away, no matter which model they choose. iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max now take spatial photos in addition to videos to help users relive memories with remarkable depth on Apple Vision Pro.
Users can capture 4K120 fps in Slo-mo or Video mode, and adjust the playback speed after capture in the Photos app, including a quarter-speed playback, a new half-speed option for a dreamy effect, and a fifth-speed option that corresponds to 24 fps. When coupled with the new image signal processor (ISP) of A18 Pro, users can do frame-by-frame cinema-quality color grading for 4K120 fps in Dolby Vision. Users can also capture 4K120 fps ProRes and Log directly to an external storage device for efficient pro workflows.
Both Pro models feature four new studio-quality mics that preserve true-to-life recorded sounds, and video can now be captured in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system. The iPhone 16 Pro lineup also introduces creative new ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix — allowing users to adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.
Next-generation Photographic Styles help users express their creativity and customize their photos by locally adjusting color, highlights, and shadows in real time. Styles also have a deeper understanding of skin undertones, so users can personalize how they appear in photos. Unlike filters, which often use a one-size-fits-all approach by adding a color to an entire scene, adjustments are applied to specific colors of a selected style. A wider set of styles offers more creative options for editing a photo’s aesthetic, and styles can be further personalized with an easy-to-use new control pad and intensity slider for simultaneous adjustments across tone and color. These adjustments can be rendered during live preview, applied after a photo is taken, or even reversed later.
Apple Intelligence takes the pro camera system to a new level. Coming later, Siri will be able to complete in-app requests and take action across apps, like pulling up a specific shot from a user’s Photos library and then applying an edit to the image in Darkroom. Siri can also help users fully utilize the wide range of photo and editing capabilities, such as asking how to adjust the blur in the background of a photo.
Industry-Leading Performance and Power Efficiency
The new A18 Pro chip is designed with industry-leading compute power to propel Apple Intelligence, ushering in a new era of pro performance. Built with second-generation 3-nanometer technology and featuring a new architecture with smaller, faster transistors, A18 Pro delivers unprecedented efficiency. The new 16-core Neural Engine is faster and more efficient than the previous generation, powering remarkable on-device performance for Apple Intelligence. A 17 percent increase in total system memory bandwidth — the highest ever in iPhone — enables faster experiences when using Writing Tools and Image Playground, and helps deliver astounding graphics. The bandwidth increase also benefits the 6-core GPU, which is up to 20 percent faster than the previous generation, driving graphics rendering for Apple Intelligence and stunning visuals for gaming. Hardware-accelerated ray tracing gets up to 2x faster for even more realistic light sources and reflections, and Game Mode in iOS 18 unlocks more consistent frame rates while making AirPods, game controllers, and other wireless accessories incredibly responsive. A new 6-core CPU is the fastest in a smartphone, with two performance cores and four efficiency cores that can run the same workload as the previous generation 15 percent faster while using 20 percent less power. Next-generation ML accelerators are optimized for Apple Intelligence, and save power by handling high-efficiency, high-throughput, and low-latency computations on the CPU without engaging the Neural Engine.
A18 Pro enables Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience on iPhone, as well as faster USB 3 speeds and ProRes video recording. A new ISP and video encoder process 2x the amount of data for faster video encoding and pro workflows.
Expanded Safety and Communication Capabilities
The iPhone 16 Pro lineup features innovative ways to stay connected and provides enhanced safety capabilities for peace of mind. Powered by the same groundbreaking technology as Emergency SOS via satellite, users are able to connect to the nearest satellite to send and receive texts, emoji, and Tapbacks over iMessage and SMS while outside cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.2Messages via satellite in iOS 18 are end-to-end encrypted. Also new with iOS 18, Emergency SOS Live Video allows users to share a live video feed or photos with participating emergency dispatchers during an emergency call.3Later this fall, Roadside Assistance via satellite — which connects users to a roadside assistance provider if they have car trouble while off the grid — expands beyond the U.S. to the U.K.
Better for the Environment
iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is prioritizing renewable electricity in manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including the iPhone 16 lineup. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence.
To achieve Apple 2030, the company is also designing products with recycled and renewable materials. iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max feature more than 25 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled aluminum in the internal structural frame and 80 percent or more recycled steel across multiple components. The battery is made with 100 percent recycled cobalt and — in a first for iPhone — over 95 percent recycled lithium.4The iPhone 16 Pro lineup also meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and is free of mercury and PVC. The packaging is entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by next year.

UPDATE
Apple Maps introduces new ways to explore the world
Beginning today, users can discover hikes in U.S. national parks, create custom walking routes, save favorite spots to a new Places Library, and more
With the release ofiOS 18,iPadOS 18,macOS Sequoia, andwatchOS 11today, Apple Maps is introducing new features to help users explore and find places they love.
“Apple Maps is the best way to navigate and explore the world, and we’re excited to make that experience even better for our users with today’s updates,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “Maps makes it easy and enjoyable to plan any journey, with beautiful, detailed, and useful features that only Apple can deliver.”
Detailed National Park Hikes and Topographic Maps
Users can browse thousands of hikes in U.S. national parks — from Acadia National Park in Maine, to Yosemite National Park in California, to Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska — on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. To find the perfect trail, users can filter hikes by route type, length, and elevation, and follow along with turn-by-turn navigation to help them stay on track. Users can download hikes for use while offline and save them to their Apple Watch. Beginning today, Maps also displays shuttle schedules for select national parks, including Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and Sequoia National Park in California.
Topographic maps on iPhone and Apple Watch are also available for the U.S. and Japan, with stunning details like contour lines, trail details, and more.

September 16, 2024
UPDATE
watchOS 11 is available today
Introducing sleep apnea notifications, the Vitals app, training load, additional customization for Activity rings, a more personalized Smart Stack, and more
Apple today releasedwatchOS 11, bringing powerful health and fitness insights, along with even more personalization, intelligence, and ways to stay connected, to the world’s most popular watch.
Apple Watch now offers a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea,1and the new Vitals app allows users to quickly check in on key health metrics at a glance and gain better context on their health.2The ability to measure training load helps users make more informed decisions when working out for improved fitness and performance, and Activity rings are even more customizable. Apple Watch and the Health app on iPhone and iPad also provide additional support for users who are pregnant.
The Smart Stack and Photos face use intelligence to offer a more individualized experience, and Check In, the Translate app, and new capabilities for the double tap gesture come to Apple Watch for more convenience and ways to stay connected.
Sleep Apnea Notifications
Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 now offer a feature to help identify signs of sleep apnea. To detect signs of sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist during sleep that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.
Following an onboarding for the feature, the new sleep apnea notifications algorithm analyzes breathing disturbance data every 30 days, so Apple Watch can notify a user if it identifies signs of sleep apnea. The notification includes the time period when potential sleep apnea occurred and educational materials on the importance of seeking treatment, along with a PDF providing three months of breathing disturbance data, notification details, and additional information to reference during a conversation with a healthcare provider.
Sleep apnea notifications use the advanced processing power of the S9 SiP and S10 SiP and scientifically validated algorithms. The feature was developed with advanced machine learning and training data from thousands of nights of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests, andvalidatedin the largest study ever conducted for the FDA clearance of a sleep apnea device. Following FDA 510(k) clearance and additional global health authority authorizations, sleep apnea notifications are now available in more than 150 countries and regions, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.
Vitals App
The new Vitals app gives users a way to check in on their daily health status and explore noteworthy overnight health metrics at a glance, so they can easily see when the metrics are out of their typical range. When two or more metrics are out of their typical range, users can receive a notification, along with a message detailing how the changes in these specific metrics may be linked to other aspects of their life, such as elevation changes, alcohol consumption, or even illness.
To inform out-of-range classifications and notifications, Vitals uses an algorithm developed using real-world data from the Apple Heart and Movement Study, research that aims to advance the understanding of the links between heart health and physical activity.
Training Load
Training load is a way to measure how the intensity and duration of workouts are impacting a user’s body over time — a concept used by elite athletes and coaches to assist with training and performance. Apple Watch now offers users unique insights to understand their training load, which can help them make informed decisions about their training each day, particularly when preparing for an event.
Apple Watch will establish a 28-day training load, a weighted average taking into account both the duration of users’ workouts over this period and the intensity of the workouts, which is measured by a new effort rating. Effort ratings are available after each workout to track how difficult it was on a scale from 1 to 10, and popular cardio-based workout types will use a new algorithm and a combination of workout metrics to automatically generate an estimated effort rating that users can manually adjust. For workouts where an automatic estimate is not provided — like strength training — users can still enter an effort rating at the end of each workout.
In the Activity and Vitals apps, users can see how their training load for the most recent seven days compares to their 28-day training load, classified as well below, below, steady, above, or well above. This offers actionable insight into whether the current strain on their body is ramping up, staying the same, or easing off, so they can adjust their training for the best results. Additional information in the Fitness app on iPhone further details the possible impact on their fitness if they continue to train at that current level, like potential changes in fitness or risk of injury.
More Customizable Activity Rings
With watchOS 11, Activity rings are even more customizable. Activity ring goals can now be customized by the day of the week, so they are perfectly suited for users’ schedules. Whether users are planning a rest day during their training or just need a day off, they also now have the ability to pause their rings for a day, week, month, or more — without affecting their award streak. The Fitness app on iPhone also offers users the ability to customize the Summary tab.
Additional Support During Pregnancy
watchOS 11, iOS 18, and iPadOS 18 offer additional support for users who log a pregnancy in the Health app, to reflect changes in their physical and mental health during this important time. On Apple Watch, the Cycle Tracking app will show a user’s gestational age and allow them to log symptoms for things frequently experienced during pregnancy. In the Health app, they will also be prompted to review things like their high heart rate notification threshold, since heart rate tends to increase during pregnancy.
More Personalized Smart Stack
The Smart Stack is designed to help users quickly access important information from any watch face, and now uses intelligence to add and suggest widgets based on time, date, location, daily routines, and more, so it is even simpler to access features on Apple Watch when a user needs them. New widgets — including Photos, Distance, Shazam, and more — are also now available; new interactive widgets allow users to interact with an app directly from the Smart Stack; and Live Activities is now available on Apple Watch within the Smart Stack.
Check In, the Translate App, and Scrolling with the Double Tap Gesture
Check In comes to Apple Watch, and can be accessed directly from the Workout app in addition to Messages. Users can now start a Check In for the duration of their workout — whether it’s an early morning run or late-night gym session — so a friend or family member can keep an eye out for their workout to end.
The Translate app is now available on Apple Watch, using machine learning for speech recognition and rapid translation that users can access directly on their wrist. The Smart Stack can even automatically surface the Translate app widget when users are traveling to a location with a language that is different from their Apple Watch.
The double tap gesture can now be used to scroll through any app, making it even easier to interact with Apple Watch with one hand.
New Watch Faces
watchOS 11 introduces three new watch faces:
Tides App
To help users plan and enjoy open water activities and stay aware of changing conditions, watchOS 11 introduces a new Tides app to Apple Watch. Users can access seven rolling days of forecasted tidal information for coastlines and surf spots around the globe, including information on high and low tides, rising and falling tides, tide height and direction, and sunrise and sunset, all plotted against a timeline. Users can also view beaches near their location on a convenient map, and new complications show current tide information for their favorite spots or the closest beaches at a glance.
Additional watchOS 11 Updates
Privacy
Privacy is fundamental in the design and development across all of Apple’s features. When a user’s device is locked with a passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID, all of their health and fitness data in the Health app — other than Medical ID — is encrypted. Any Health data backed up to iCloud is encrypted both in transit and on Apple servers. When using iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS with the default two-factor authentication and a passcode, Health app data synced to iCloud is encrypted end-to-end, meaning that Apple does not have the key to decrypt the data and therefore cannot read it.
Availability
watchOS 11 is available today for Apple Watch Series 6 and later, and requires iPhone XSor later running iOS 18. Not all features are available on all devices and in all regions.

September 16, 2024
UPDATE
iOS 18 is available today, making iPhone more personal and capable than ever
iOS 18is now available, bringing iPhone users around the world new ways to personalize their iPhone with deeper customization to the Home Screen and Control Center; the biggest-ever redesign to Photos, making it even easier to find and relive special moments; and major enhancements to Messages and Mail. Starting next month, iOS 18 will introduce Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant while protecting users’ privacy and security.1
More Customization Than Ever
In iOS 18, users can customize their Home Screen in exciting new ways by placing app icons and widgets to frame the wallpaper or create the ideal layout on each page. Users can also choose how the app icons and widgets are presented — light, dark, or with a colored tint — or make app icons appear larger for a new streamlined look. Control Center is redesigned to be even more flexible. Powerful groups of controls — including favorites, media playback, Home controls and connectivity, and the new controls gallery featuring options from third-party apps — can be organized so that they’re always just a swipe away. Users can also access their favorite controls from the Action button, and for the first time, users can change the controls on the Lock Screen or remove them entirely.
The Biggest Photos Redesign
The biggest-ever update to Photos makes it easier to find and relive special moments. The beautiful, simplified layout puts the library into a unified yet familiar view. New collections like Recent Days, People & Pets, and Trips automatically keep the library organized with on-device intelligence, so users can spend less time searching and more time enjoying their memories. Users can personalize their experience with a customizable layout that reflects what is most important to them and pin favorite collections to keep them easily accessible.
Powerful Ways to Stay Connected in Messages and Phone
Messages offers major updates to the ways users express themselves and stay connected. Formatting options like bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough let users better convey tone; all-new text effects bring words, phrases, and sentences to life; emoji and sticker Tapbacks give users endless ways to react in a conversation; and users can compose an iMessage to send later. For times when cellular and Wi-Fi connections aren’t available, Messages via satellite connects users to a satellite in space right from the Messages app to send and receive texts, emoji, and Tapbacks over iMessage and SMS.2When messaging contacts who do not have an Apple device, the Messages app now supports RCS for richer media and more reliable group messaging compared to SMS and MMS.3
The Phone app helps users stay organized with the ability to record and transcribe live calls, making it easier to recall important details later.4Call participants are notified before a recording begins, and transcripts are conveniently saved to the Notes app, allowing users to quickly search and review what was discussed.
Intelligent Categorization in Mail
Available later this year, categorization in Mail organizes messages to help users stay on top of their inbox. The Primary category lets users focus on the messages that matter most or contain time-sensitive information. Transactions, Updates, and Promotions are grouped by sender in a new digest view that pulls together all relevant emails from a business, allowing users to quickly scan for what’s important in the moment.
Distraction-Free Browsing with Safari
Safari is the world’s fastest browser, and with iOS 18, it offers even more capabilities for browsing the web.5Highlights intelligently surface key information — like a location’s address, a summary, or more information about a movie, TV show, or song — after a webpage is loaded. The redesigned Reader brings more ways to enjoy articles with a streamlined view, a summary, and a table of contents for longer articles. With Distraction Control, users can hide items on a webpage that they may find disruptive to their browsing, such as sign-in banners or content overlays within a website.
The Brand-New Passwords App
Passwords is a new app built on the foundation of Keychain that makes it even easier for users to access their passwords and see all their credentials — like passwords, passcodes, and verification codes — all in one place. Passwords is backed by incredibly secure end-to-end encryption; seamlessly syncs across devices; and alerts users when a password could be easily guessed, has been used multiple times, or has appeared in a known data leak.
Privacy Features Designed to Empower Users
iOS 18 gives users tools to manage who can see their apps, how their contacts are shared, and how their iPhone connects to accessories. Locked and hidden apps offer users peace of mind that information they want to keep private, such as app notifications and content, will not inadvertently be seen by others. Users can now lock an app, and for additional privacy, they can also hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system. In addition, iOS 18 lets users share only specific contacts with an app, and developers can offer users a more seamless and private experience when connecting third-party accessories with iPhone.
The First Set of Apple Intelligence Features Available Next Month
Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, harnessing the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks — all while protecting users’ privacy and security. Thefirst set of Apple Intelligence featureswill be available next month, delivering experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them.
With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. In addition, natural language can be used to search for specific photos, and search in videos gets more powerful with the ability to find specific moments in clips. The new Clean Up tool can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject. And in the Notes and Phone apps, users can record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help recall key points.
Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience. It has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPhone. Users can type to Siri at any time on iPhone, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and can maintain context from one request to the next. In addition, with Siri’s extensive product knowledge, it can now answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple devices.
With many Apple Intelligence models running entirely on device, as well as the introduction of Private Cloud Compute — which extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence — Apple Intelligence represents an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence.

September 16, 2024
UPDATE
macOS Sequoia is available today, bringing iPhone Mirroring, Apple Intelligence, and more to Mac
macOS Sequoia, the latest version of the world’s most advanced desktop operating system, is available today as a free software update for Mac. macOS Sequoia brings exciting new features, including iPhone Mirroring, which expands Continuity by enabling access to and control of iPhone directly from macOS; big updates to Safari; a new Passwords app; and more. Starting next month, macOS Sequoia will introduce Apple Intelligence,1the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant while protecting users’ privacy and security.
Here’s a look at the top features Mac users can experience when they update to macOS Sequoia.
iPhone Mirroring
Working across iPhone and Mac gets even easier with the newest Continuity feature in macOS Sequoia — iPhone Mirroring. Users can now access and engage with their iPhone right from their Mac. Custom wallpaper and app icons appear just like on iPhone. With iPhone Mirroring, users can also swipe between pages on the Home Screen; launch and browse favorite apps; and review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac. And iPhone remains locked the whole time, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, so users can continue to get information at a glance on their iPhone as they use iPhone Mirroring.
More Surfing Power in Safari
Safari is the world’s fastest browser,2and it’s even easier to discover new information on the web with the new Highlights feature. Powered by machine learning, Highlights automatically surfaces directions for a location, summaries of articles, or quick links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows. A redesigned Reader allows users to read articles more quickly with a streamlined view, a summary, and a table of contents, and a new Viewer helps users put videos front and center while still giving them full access to system playback controls. With Distraction Control, users can hide items on a webpage that they may find disruptive to their browsing.
Easier Window Tiling
New ways to arrange windows let users stay organized with the layout that works best for them. By simply dragging a window to the edge of the screen, macOS Sequoia automatically suggests a tiled position on the user’s desktop. Users can release a window right into place, quickly arrange tiles side by side, or place them in corners to keep even more apps in view. And new keyboard and menu shortcuts help organize tiles even faster.
A New Passwords App
An all-new Passwords app makes it even easier to access passwords, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and other credentials all in one convenient place on Mac. The Passwords app is backed by incredibly secure end-to-end encryption. It works great with Safari, and seamlessly syncs between all of a user’s Apple devices and Windows with the iCloud for Windows app.
Video Conferencing Updates
During video calls in FaceTime or third-party apps like Webex, users can apply beautiful built-in backgrounds, including a variety of color gradients or shots of the scenery in and around locations like Apple Park in Cupertino, California. They can even upload their own photos to use as a background, And with Apple’s industry-leading segmentation, users will look their best on every call. With presenter preview, users can now see what they’re about to share before sharing it with apps like FaceTime and Zoom.
Coming Soon: Apple Intelligence
Apple Intelligencewill transform what users can do with Mac, delivering intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant to them, while protecting their privacy and keeping them in control of their data. Apple Intelligence will be available on Macs with an M-series chip, harnessing the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to understand and create language and images; take action across apps; and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks. Writing Tools help rewrite, proofread, and summarize text. Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience, and with richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next. Mac users can type to Siri and fluidly switch between text and voice to accelerate everyday tasks. In addition, with Siri’s extensive product knowledge, users can now get answers to thousands of questions about the features and settings on Mac. With many of the Apple Intelligence models running entirely on device, as well as the introduction of Private Cloud Compute — which extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence — Apple Intelligence introduces an extraordinary step forward for privacy in artificial intelligence.
Additional Features
In macOS Sequoia, there are many more unique and useful features added to users’ favorite Mac apps.
Messages
In Messages, users can now schedule messages to send later. Text messages can also come to life with unique text effects that visually amplify words or emoji with animations like “explode,” “ripple,” and “nod,” and users can even tap back with any emoji or sticker they want.
Notes
In theNotes app, users can now record audio and receive a live transcription, making it incredibly easy to capture every detail of a lecture, meeting, or conversation, and Apple Intelligence will automatically generate a summary. Math Notes also comes to macOS Sequoia, enabling users to instantly solve an expression or math problem simply by typing it into the Notes app on Mac.

September 16, 2024
UPDATE
iPadOS 18 is now available, taking iPad to the next level with powerful new intelligence features and experiences designed for Apple Pencil
iPadOS 18makes the iPad experience more versatile and intelligent than ever, and is available today as a free software update. iPadOS 18 brings incredible new features designed for the unique capabilities of iPad, making it even easier for users to get tasks done. With iPadOS 18, Calculator comes to iPad with Math Notes, along with new Smart Script handwriting tools in Notes — all designed for Apple Pencil. Additionally, iPad users now have more ways to customize the Home Screen and Control Center, and users receive the biggest redesign of the Photos app ever, new ways to express themselves in Messages, and so much more.
Starting next month, iPadOS 18 running on iPad with M1 and later will mark the introduction ofApple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant for iPad users, unlocking new ways for users to enhance their writing, communicate more effectively, and express themselves.1
Calculator on iPad Delivers a New Way to Solve with Math Notes
Designed for the unique capabilities of iPad, Calculator delivers an entirely new way to use Apple Pencil to solve expressions, as well as basic and scientific calculators with a new history function and unit conversions. With Math Notes, users are now able to type mathematical expressions or write them out to see them instantly solved in handwriting like their own. They can also create and use variables, and add an equation to insert a graph. Users can access their Math Notes in the Notes app, and use all of the math functionality in any of their other notes.
More Flexible Handwritten Notes with Smart Script
Handwritten notes become more fluid, flexible, and easy to read with Smart Script and the power of Apple Pencil. Smart Script unleashes powerful new capabilities for users editing handwritten text, allowing them to easily add space, or even paste typed text in their own handwriting — making editing handwritten text just as simple and flexible as editing typed text. Users can even scratch out handwritten text to delete it. Smart Script also maintains the look and feel of a user’s personal handwriting, automatically refining it in real time to be smoother, straighter, and more legible.
More Ways to Customize iPad
In iPadOS 18, users can customize their Home Screen in exciting new ways by placing app icons and widgets in any open position to frame the wallpaper or create the ideal layout on each page. App icons can be customized to appear light, dark, with a tint, and larger for a new streamlined look that removes the name underneath. And Control Center has been redesigned to provide easier access to many of the things users do every day, with new levels of customization, delivering quick access to new groups of a user’s most-utilized controls. Additionally, users can now add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center, and developers can take advantage of the new Controls API to let their users accomplish even more tasks, like quickly starting a virtual meeting or kicking off a livestream for their followers.
A Redesigned Photos App to Relive Special Moments
The Photos app receives its biggest update ever, bringing users powerful new tools that make it easier to find what they are looking for. A simplified and customizable app layout takes advantage of the larger display on iPad and helps users browse by themes without having to organize content into albums. Photos uses on-device machine learning to automatically organize a library by helpful topics, like people and pets, recent days, trips, and even documents and receipts.
New Ways to Stay Connected in Messages
iPadOS 18 brings users new ways to stay connected and expressive in Messages, with all-new animated text effects, redesigned Tapbacks that expand to include any emoji or sticker, and new text formatting options, including bold, underline, and italics. Messages also introduces the ability to schedule messages to send at a later time, helping users stay fully in control of when and how they are communicating with their contacts.
New Privacy Controls
With new privacy controls, iPadOS 18 gives users even more ways to control who can see their apps, how they share their contacts, and how their iPad connects to accessories. Users can now lock an app; and for additional privacy, they can hide an app, moving it to a locked, hidden apps folder. When an app is locked or hidden, content like messages or emails inside the app are hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the system.
A New Tab Bar Brings Easier Navigation
A redesigned tab bar floats above app content, making it easier to navigate and keeping content edge to edge. The tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar when users want to dive deeper into an app’s full functionality, seen with apps including Apple TV, News, Books, and Fitness. Users will also enjoy refined animations that make apps feel even more fluid and responsive, as well as an updated document browser that gives apps a distinct look and feel when accessing documents in apps like Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and Swift Playgrounds.
Apple Intelligence Makes iPad Even More Useful and Delightful
Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iPadOS 18 on iPad with M1 and later, harnessing the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks — all while protecting users’ privacy and security.
Apple Intelligence powers experiences that are delightful, intuitive, easy to use, and specially designed to help users do the things that matter most to them. With Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience, and gets a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPad. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and can maintain context from one request to the next. Users can type to Siri at any time, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. In Photos, the Memories feature now enables users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description; and with the new Clean Up tool, they can identify and remove distracting objects in the background of a photo — without accidentally altering the subject.
Apple Intelligence is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device. To run more complex requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. Private Cloud Compute marks a fundamental breakthrough in server-based intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts have access to continuously verify this privacy promise, and are already doing so.
The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in beta for iPad users next month as part of iPadOS 18.1, with more features rolling out later this year and in the months following. Apple Intelligence first launches in U.S. English, and will quickly expand to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. in December, with additional language support — such as Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish — coming next year.
New Hearing Health Features Come to iPadOS 18 and iOS 18
Later this fall, AirPods Pro 2 add a clinical-grade, over-the-counter Hearing Aid capability for users with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. Based on results from an intuitive, clinically validated Hearing Test that users can take from the comfort of their own home using AirPods Pro 2 and a compatible iPhone or iPad, this new feature seamlessly transforms AirPods Pro into a personalized Hearing Aid set to meet the specific needs of the user, making access to hearing assistance easier than ever as a free software update.2
Availability
iPadOS 18 is available for iPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st generation and later), iPad Air (M2), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (7th generation and later), and iPad mini (5th generation and later).

2024-09-19,Increase,Apple introduces California driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet as part of California DMV’s mDL pilot program,"Text of this article
September 19, 2024
UPDATE
Apple introduces California driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet as part of California DMV’s mDL pilot program
IDs in Wallet provides an easy, secure, and private way for residents to present their IDs with iPhone and Apple Watch
Today, Apple announced California driver’s licenses and state IDs can now be added to Apple Wallet, enabling residents to seamlessly and securely add and present their IDs using iPhone or Apple Watch.1The launch of California driver’s licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet will roll out as part of the California DMV’s broadermobile driver’s license (mDL) pilot program, which launched last year and is limited to 1.5 million participants.
“Enabling California residents to seamlessly add and present their IDs with their iPhone or Apple Watch represents a significant step in replacing the physical wallet with a more secure and private digital wallet,” said Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. “The launch also represents an important milestone in the rollout of IDs in Apple Wallet. Not only is California one of the largest states in the U.S., but it’s also our own backyard, and we’re excited to bring an easy and transparent way to present IDs in our home state.”
“Californians now have the option of adding their driver’s license or state ID to their iPhone or Apple Watch in Apple Wallet,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom. “With this new integration, we’re working to better serve the people of California in the 21st century.”
The addition of IDs in Wallet in California follows the recent launch in Hawaii and Ohio, which join Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland. Additionally, Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia have signed on to adopt IDs in Wallet. Japan has also signed on to bring My Number Card to Wallet, which will mark the first international expansion of IDs in Wallet.
Adding an ID in Apple Wallet
Adding a license or state ID to Apple Wallet can be done in a few easy steps. Residents can tap the Add (+) button at the top of the screen in Wallet on their iPhone, select “Driver’s License or State ID,” and follow the onscreen instructions to start the setup and verification process.
The customer will be asked to use their iPhone to scan their physical driver’s license or state ID card and take a selfie, which will be securely provided to the issuing state for verification. As an additional security step, users will also be prompted to complete a series of facial and head movements during the setup process. Once verified by the issuing state, the customer’s ID or driver’s license will be added to Wallet.
Using an ID in Apple Wallet
Users can securely present their IDs in Apple Wallet in person and in apps to show proof of age or identity.
To present an ID in person, users can go to Apple Wallet and select their ID in Apple Wallet. From there, they can hold their iPhone or Apple Watch near an identity reader, review the specific information being requested, and use Face ID or Touch ID to authenticate. Today, users can present their ID in Apple Wallet at select TSA checkpoints, businesses, and venues, in addition to Apple Store locations across the U.S. for order pickup, Genius Bar appointments, and more. Users can also present their IDs in Apple Wallet to businesses using apps such as Tap2iD Mobile, VeriScan, and Mobile ID Verify, for in-person age verification. These apps leverage Apple’s ID Verifier API to securely and privately accept mobile driver’s licenses and ID cards — right on iPhone, no additional hardware needed.
Soon, users will also be able to present their ID in Apple Wallet in person for select services like CLEAR for member enrollment.
To present an ID in Apple Wallet in apps, users can select the “Verify with Apple Wallet” or “Continue with Apple Wallet” button. From there, they can review the specific information being requested, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID before information is shared. Today, users can present their ID in Apple Wallet in select apps, including Turo, with additional partners such as CLEAR, MyChart, and Uber Eats coming soon.
Presenting an ID in a Secure, Private Way
IDs in Apple Wallet use the privacy and security features that are built into Apple devices to help protect a user’s identity and personal information. When adding an ID to Apple Wallet, the state-issuing authority receives only the information it needs to approve or deny the request.
Once an ID is added to Apple Wallet, the information is encrypted on a user’s device, so others — including Apple — cannot access it unless a user chooses to present it. Apple and the state-issuing authority do not know when or to whom a user presents their driver’s license or state ID. A user’s presentment history is encrypted and stored only on their device, and Apple cannot see or access this information.
When presenting an ID in Apple Wallet, only the information needed for the transaction is presented, and the user has the opportunity to review and authorize the information being requested with Face ID or Touch ID before it is shared. Users do not need to unlock, show, or hand over their device to present their ID.

UPDATE
Apple Podcasts spotlights narrative series
A brand-new chart, category, and celebration of essential series launches today only on Apple Podcasts
Today, Apple Podcasts is elevating series — narrative shows with episodes intended to be listened to in order — that captivate listeners across multiple genres. Apple Podcasts is launching a new Top Series chart that will be updated continuously and features the top 100 series, making it the first chart for series shows ever created. Additionally, a brand-new Series category will help listeners explore and discover shows they will love. Lastly, Apple Podcasts editors will introduce Series Essentials, recognizing and celebrating one series each month that best defines the category, beginning withGhost Story, an original limited series from Wondery and Audacy’s Pineapple Street Studios.
“Serialized podcasts are some of the most impactful shows in podcasting, featuring captivating voice talent and best-in-class writing and sound design. They are the stories we can’t stop thinking about and are talking about even years later,” said Ben Cave, Apple’s global head of Podcasts. “We are thrilled to celebrate this incredible catalog with a new Top Series chart, Series category, and Series Essentials on Apple Podcasts, making it easier for listeners to discover their next favorite show.”
“I live for stories in any form — books, TV segments, documentaries, movies, graphic novels... any story, any form. But I am never more dialed into a story than when I am hooked on a podcast series,” said Rachel Maddow, host of MSNBC’sRachel Maddow Presents: Bag ManandRachel Maddow Presents: Ultra. “There’s just something about a single story — one voice, a sustained narrative that builds from episode to episode and then to an ending. We’re wired to not just learn things this way, but to feel them, too. For my seriesUltraandBag Man, I’ve heard from so many people that these big historical and political tales became for them not just relatable, but emotional. I really think that most of the best stories take longer than one sitting to tell — and that the best stories in the world right now are being told in podcast series.”
“Making a short series requires such a monumental amount of work and dedication that I must bow to the audio producers of the world who still do it,” said Jad Abumrad, creator ofRadiolab,More Perfect, andDolly Parton’s America. “I’m glad to hear that Apple Podcasts is supporting these critical shows and the producers who make them. I can’t wait to explore their selections and find inspiration.”
Top Series Chart
Apple Podcasts is introducing a Top Series chart, making it the first chart for serialized shows in the industry. This new chart offers listeners a dedicated space to discover their next favorite series show, while celebrating the creators who have developed some of the most popular and trending shows on Apple Podcasts. Series shows make up the majority of the most-shared and top new shows each year. As with all other charts on Apple Podcasts, Top Series will be updated continuously.
Series Essentials
Series Essentials will spotlight the pinnacle of podcasting, celebrating the finest storytelling and the medium’s greatest achievements. Each month, Apple Podcasts’ editors will recognize one show that captivates listeners and demonstrates masterful storytelling, artistic excellence, a distinct creator’s voice and vision, and exceptional craft. In its featured month, each Series Essentials selection will be presented completely ad-free in its entirety on Apple Podcasts.
Ghost Story, hosted by seasoned journalist Tristan Redman, was chosen as the first Series Essential selection for its compelling and timeless story, which intertwines Redman’s personal family history with his own desire for truth. The show spans multiple genres — including true crime, personal narrative, and historical tale — captivating a broad range of audiences.
“Limited series shows likeGhost Storyallow Wondery an opportunity to work with some of the best journalists and storytellers, finding new voices and stories to propel this medium forward,” said Jen Sargent, Wondery’s CEO. “Apple Podcasts’ Series Essentials are incredibly exciting and innovative as they shine a light on and celebrate these compelling stories, driving more discoverability and bringing in new audiences.”
“We are thrilled that Apple Podcasts has chosenGhost Storyto be the first Series Essential,” said Redman. “After just a year,to be considered for this collection is special. We’re all after stories that pull us in. Long-form series podcasts do that; they deserve to be celebrated.”
This gripping tale begins with a childhood bedroom haunting, becomes an investigation into a 1930s murder, and concludes with a meditation about the risks and rewards of unearthing family history. The story features homicide detectives, ghost hunters, and even psychic mediums, as well as the people closest to the investigation — members of the Dancy family, including Tristan’s brother-in-law, the actor Hugh Dancy — speaking for the first time about the murders.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple launches new professional learning resources for teachers and expands global education grant program
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAIn celebration of World Teachers’ Day, Apple today launched all-new free classroom resources to help educators and students embrace creativity in any lesson, and is celebrating educators through special collections and offerings across Apple services. Additionally, the company announced a major expansion of its groundbreaking education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, reaching students and teachers across six continents with free grant-funded STEAM programming.
Over the past four decades, Apple has been a committed educational leader. Through its work in education, the company has shared its cutting-edge technology and professional learning resources with millions of students and educators, equipping them with the tools to create new worlds, connect in engaging ways, and pursue the jobs of tomorrow. To illustrate the reach of its efforts, Apple is also releasing its first-everEducation Impact Report, which provides a snapshot of the work the company is doing to support teachers and learners worldwide.
“At Apple, we have always believed in the power of education to open new doors and give people the tools they need to build a better, more equitable world,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’re blown away to see how tomorrow’s coders, creators, innovators, and leaders are using Apple technology and resources to make their impact known today — and we’re thrilled to expand our education work into even more communities.”
“We’re inspired by the incredible work coming out of classrooms and communities across the globe, and the myriad of ways Apple products like Mac and iPad empower learners to create and build on their passions,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Education and Enterprise Marketing. “Our new Creative Activities for early learners and students make learning easy and fun, and most importantly, give educators quick tools to engage learners of all ages.”
Supporting Teachers and Community Educators with New Tools
Over the course of Apple’s long history in education, professional learning and educator resources have always been key parts of the company’s approach, as the effective use of technology can help unlock the potential of all learners.
Today, Apple is launching new Everyone Can Create resources for teachers. Creative Activities are a collection of quick, interactive, and fun lesson ideas that empower educators to sprinkle imagination and originality into their learning plans. Creative Activities for Early Learners (ages 4 to 8) and Creative Activities for Students (ages 8 and up) enable teachers to engage their students without increasing their workload. Each activity strengthens essential skills and gets students creating quickly with templates and shareable links.
New Creative Activities include:
The new Creative Activities are now available in theApple Education Community, a professional learning hub with more than 1 million members where educators can find inspiration, share resources, and connect with peers. This week, the Apple Education Community is expanding its Forum collaboration features to 16 additional countries and regions, enabling participation from even more educators around the world.1
In addition, Apple continues to expand Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that helps educators coach teachers on how to get the most out of Apple products. With new lessons and the ability to register and participate at any time, Apple Learning Coach is now available in eight languages across 15 countries and regions.2To date, more than 4,000 certified Apple Learning Coaches have guided nearly 100,000 teachers, impacting 2.4 million students.
Reaching Students and Teachers on Six Continents Through Grant Programs
Apple works with schools and nonprofit organizations around the world to provide grants and other hands-on programming designed to expand access to technology, along with educational and workforce opportunities. To date, the company has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in technology, tools, and resources to more than 200 education and community partners. In the last year alone, Apple has expanded its support to nearly 40 new education partners across Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
This work is largely connected to Apple’s Community Education Initiative, through which the company provides hardware, scholarships, financial support, educator resources, and access to Apple experts to schools and organizations in under-resourced communities. Apple collaborates with each partner organization to customize and enhance programming to support the community’s specific goals and transform students’ in-school and extracurricular experiences.
Apple’s extensiveeducation initiativesalso include Apple Developer Academies and the Apple Foundation Program, which bring coding education and skills training to developers and entrepreneurs around the world, along with free resources like Everyone Can Code, Develop in Swift Tutorials, Everyone Can Create, Challenge for Change, and Today at Apple sessions at all Apple Store locations.
As detailed in the newly released Education Impact Report, in the past five years, more than 10,000 teachers have received professional learning opportunities through Apple grants. Over that same time frame, 500,000 students in close to 2,000 schools and communities around the world have engaged in the company’s grant programs. Apple currently supports more than 200 schools and nonprofit organizations — a number that continues to increase.
Forging New Partnerships and Deepening Existing Work
CodeDoor, one of Apple’s newer partners, provides coding and workforce preparedness training for migrants throughout Germany. Apple supports the organization’s Creators program, which uses Everyone Can Code resources and Swift Playgrounds to give participants the tools to design and pitch apps as solutions to community challenges. Through a hybrid experience that takes place over the course of eight months, participants acquire valuable skills, including coding with Swift and presentation techniques.
“CodeDoor was created from the idea that young people are curious and approach learning as a process of discovery, but need the right tools to feel empowered,” said Karan Dehghani, CodeDoor’s founder. “With support from Apple, our Creators program teaches learners from migrant families how to identify and solve real-life problems through app development — equipping a new generation of Germans with the skills they need to build community and a brighter future.”
Apple is also deepening its work with existing community partners. Since 2020, the company has collaborated with the New York Public Library to expand access to technology through in-person and virtual training classes for learners of all ages and skill levels, with a focus on helping adults develop confidence in their computer skills and grow more comfortable in today’s digital world.
“The world is evolving so fast. One of the ways that we can help shape and ensure the future of libraries is to create spaces that are designed for collaborative, interactive learning,” said Brandy McNeil, Ph.D., the New York Public Library’s deputy director of Branch Programs & Services. “With the tools and resources only Apple can provide, we’ve been able to expand both our programming and our reach to better serve our community, helping many more people harness the power of technology to learn and grow.”
Celebrating World Teachers’ Day Across Apple
In honor of World Teachers’ Day, Apple is celebrating educators around the world through special collections and offerings across its services.
TheGreat Tools for Teachers collectionin the App Store highlights classroom and lesson-planning essentials that educators can use to support their work. On Apple Music, users can listen to acollection of learning-based albums and playlistshighlighted throughout the Kids and Family categories; on Apple Books, readers can explore acollection of nonfiction and kids’ booksabout inspiring educators; and in Podcasts, listeners can findfeatured showsfocusing on conversations by and for educators alongside narratives about education.

UPDATE
Apple expands tools to help businesses connect with customers
With Apple Business Connect, businesses of all sizes, regardless of whether they have a physical location, can create a brand that appears to over 1 billion Apple users
For the first time, businesses of all sizes around the world — even those without a brick-and-mortar presence — can manage the way they appear to over 1 billion Apple users usingApple Business Connect. Any verified business can now create a consistent brand and location presence across apps that customers use every day, including Apple Maps, Wallet, and Mail.
“We’re excited to offer all businesses — including those without a physical location — the ability to create a brand that appears across the Apple apps that over a billion people use every day,” said David Dorn, Apple’s senior director of Internet Software and Services Product. “We designed Business Connect to empower businesses to present the best, most accurate information to Apple users. With today’s updates, we’re helping even more businesses reach customers, build trust, and grow.”
Tools to Help Every Business Grow
Since last year, businesses have been able toclaim and manage their location place cardsthrough Business Connect, including adding and updating photos and logos; inviting customers to take actions like ordering food or making a reservation directly from the place card; and presenting customers with special promotions.
Now, every business — including those that provide a service or operate fully online or without a physical location — can register for Business Connect to create a visual brand identity, making it easier to connect with customers and build trust.
New Features in Business Connect
Through new capabilities within Business Connect, businesses can sign up to display their brand in the Mail and Phone apps, and customize their logo in Tap to Pay on iPhone.
With Branded Mail, businesses can display their brand name and logo in emails to customers, so their emails stand out in the Mail app and are more easily recognizable. Businesses can sign up for Branded Mail today, and their logo will begin appearing to customers later this year.
Additionally, businesses can now choose to display their logo, rather than a category icon, when accepting payments through Tap to Pay on iPhone, so customers know they’re making a payment to a trusted and verified business.
Next year, businesses will also be able to register for Business Caller ID. Their name, logo, and department appear on the inbound call screen when they contact customers, helping to distinguish verified businesses from spam callers and other unwanted outreach.
How to Register
Owners of virtual, online, and service businesses can now use their existing Apple Account — or create a new Apple Account — to register for Business Connect at the self-service website from any cell phone, tablet, desktop, or laptop computer. Once a business has signed up, they can begin to customize their brand for free.

UPDATE
Apple celebrates 10 years of Apple Pay
Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, reflects on a decade of Apple Pay enriching users’ lives, and shares new ways to pay with Apple Pay, including rewards and installments
When we started our journey with Apple Pay 10 years ago, we saw a unique opportunity to leverage Apple’s hardware and software to make a meaningful impact on the financial health and lives of our customers. From the outset, we envisioned a world where you could use your iPhone to seamlessly pay for everything — from groceries to train tickets, in person and online, across the globe — all while keeping your personal and financial information safe and private.
Today, Apple Pay is used by hundreds of millions of consumers in 78 markets, at checkout on millions of websites and apps, in tens of millions of stores worldwide, and is supported by more than 11,000 bank and network partners. We hear from customers every day about how much they love the ease, security, and privacy protections Apple Pay provides in their daily lives, and how much they enjoy using it across their devices — including iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac.
One of my earliest memories of realizing how Apple Pay was positively impacting consumers’ lives was when we rolled out Apple Pay for transit in Tokyo, which is used by millions of travelers every day. I watched in awe as people quickly tapped their iPhone or Apple Watch to pay while passing through the turnstiles — no need to fish out any cash, cards, or coins from their wallets, or even unlock or wake their device. It’s a great example of how Apple Pay’s seamless and secure customer experience delivers convenience and peace of mind to consumers around the world, whether they’re commuting to work, shopping online, or picking up their morning coffee.
We know how important it is for customers to feel secure and trust that their financial transactions are private when making a payment. That’s why we’re always working to safeguard consumers, while also enabling banks to have industry-low levels of fraud for Apple Pay transactions. And it’s also why Apple Pay was designed to protect users’ highly sensitive personal and financial information, like their card number, which is never shared with merchants. Our customers trust that when they use Apple Pay anywhere, they can have the peace of mind that their payments are protected.
Looking ahead at what’s next for Apple Pay, we are excited to now bring our users more ways to pay, including the option to redeem rewards and access installment loans from Apple Pay-enabled issuers and lenders right at checkout with Apple Pay online and in-app on iPhone and iPad. This gives consumers greater flexibility in how they pay with the easy and trusted Apple Pay experience they already know and love. It also provides Apple Pay-enabled issuers and lenders with new ways to connect with their customers, and make their rewards and installment offerings even more accessible.
Beyond payments, we’re also advancing our broader vision of replacing users’ physical wallets with an easy, secure, and private digital wallet — Apple Wallet. Today, users can seamlessly and securely add and access eligible event tickets, transit cards, keys, government IDs, and more all from Apple Wallet. And we’re always looking for new ways to make using Apple Wallet convenient while delivering unparalleled security and peace of mind.
The last decade was an incredible journey, and we’re thrilled that so many people around the world are enjoying the experience that Apple Pay and Apple Wallet provide. I can’t wait to see what the next 10 years have in store.
— Jennifer Bailey, Apple’s vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet

Inside the Audio Lab:How Apple developed the world’s first end‑to‑end hearing health experience
Apple’s state-of-the-art Audio Lab in Cupertino, California, supports the innovative work of its acoustic engineers. They use the lab to conduct user studies in various listening rooms and test new features in its anechoic chambers, which completely absorb reflective sounds and isolate external noise.
The Audio Lab is the hub for the design, measurement, tuning, and validation of all of Apple’s products with speakers or microphones. It’s also the center for Apple’s multiyear, cross-team collaboration to build the groundbreaking newhearing health features on AirPods Pro 2. Available today as a free software update,1the end-to-end experience helps minimize exposure to loud environmental noise with Hearing Protection, track hearing with an at-home Hearing Test, and receive assistance for perceived mild to moderate hearing loss using AirPods Pro as a clinical-grade Hearing Aid.
According to the World Health Organization, approximately 1.5 billion people around the world are living with hearing loss. “Hearing loss affects individuals in every region and country, yet often goes unrecognized. Hearing is a core component of communication for so many and is an important factor for health and wellbeing,” says Shelly Chadha, M.D., the World Health Organization’s technical lead for hearing. “Technology can play an important role in raising awareness and providing intervention options for those affected by hearing loss.”
“Every person’s hearing is different, so we created an innovative, end-to-end hearing health experience that addresses this variability in a way that’s both simple to use and adaptable to a wide range of needs. That’s especially important because hearing loss affects people of all ages with different levels of tech savviness,” says Sumbul Desai, M.D., Apple’s vice president of Health. “With the Hearing Aid feature, we wanted to build something so intuitive, it felt like an extension of your senses. We knew the results would literally change people’s lives — and democratize access to treatment for a condition that affects more than a billion people.”
Engineers used highly specialized spaces across the Audio Lab to help make these breakthrough features possible.
“From the quietest sounds we can hear for the Hearing Test feature, to speech in noisy restaurants for the Hearing Aid feature, and even concert levels for Hearing Protection, we can bring the real world into our acoustics facilities with playback of calibrated soundscapes from all over the world, or take accurate acoustic measurements at the touch of a button,” says Kuba Mazur, Apple’s hearing health lead engineer within Acoustics Engineering.
The Longwave anechoic chamber was built on a separate foundation that uses springs to isolate it from the rest of the lab, allowing for accurate sound measurements without any noise or vibration disturbances. The chamber includes a custom-built loudspeaker and microphone arc that can measure head-related transfer functions, or in other words, how sound interacts with the human body. Having both the loudspeaker and microphone arrays within this chamber makes it a unique space with many applications, including AirPods, iPhone, and HomePod development.
“Your ears are natural amplifiers, each uniquely shaped and often slightly asymmetric,” Mazur continues. “When sound reaches one ear first before the other, it creates a time difference in how we perceive sound. This is important for us to understand so we can build experiences that accurately represent the sounds in your environment. And we do this in our anechoic chambers by having someone sit in a rotating chair with AirPods Pro to capture the audio.”
On the other side of the Audio Lab, to ensure the highest sound quality in every audio product Apple makes, the Fantasia Lab uses a spherical array of 50 loudspeakers to simulate hundreds of real-world sound scenes — like a shopping mall, busy street, or travel on an airplane — in a tightly controlled, evenly distributed sound field.
To fine-tune and validate the Hearing Aid feature, a broad demographic of study participants with a wide range of hearing levels were put into this controlled environment to complete a speech-in-noise test. The test consisted of a participant sitting in a chair in the middle of the space while a complex sound scene, like a noisy restaurant, played. The participant then had to repeat the words of a single speaker, distinguishing from background conversations.
“This lab is about recreating. Just as our users experience their everyday lives moving through shopping malls or having dinner with loved ones, we had to ensure these features would meet their needs,” says Mazur. “We brought the outside in to tune and validate features that we’re building on AirPods, like the Hearing Aid feature, Conversation Boost, and Transparency mode.”
Additionally, three clinical-grade audiometric booths — the type that patients would typically encounter during hearing tests in a clinician’s office — are permanently installed in the Audio Lab. For internal testing, the engineering team worked with audiologists in the booths to conduct thousands of clinical-grade audiometry tests and software-based hearing tests prior to moving the new Hearing Test feature into clinical validation studies.
Design is also core to the user experience and played an important role in user testing of the new features. One key experience was taking the test itself. The team had to identify design approaches that would simplify the Hearing Test and Hearing Aid setup. It also needed to be easier to understand than the typical series of numbers a person receives during a doctor’s visit.
“Within our health features, we focus on clarity and meeting users where they’re at,” says Heather Daniel, a producer in Apple’s Design Studio who helps manage all of the design work for health features. “Take the Hearing Test feature. We understood that for many people, this might be their very first time taking a hearing test, so we had to make it as seamless as possible.”
Simplifying these experiences required teams across Apple working together every step of the way to build this software to meet the requirements for clinical testing and delivering the best product to customers.
“Just thinking about the innovation that was necessary, the density of the technology that goes into AirPods, and the amount of effort and attention to detail that went into building these complex software features,” Mazur continues, “so many teams came together — including software and hardware engineering, design, health, accessibility, clinical ops, regulatory, and the human factors engineering team — to ensure the best quality and experience.”
The end-to-end hearing health experience on AirPods Pro 2 is just the latest example of Apple’s commitment to helping users on their personal health journeys. For many team members, it’s the epitome of what is possible when innovation meets passion to deliver products and software that are useful and help improve users’ day to day.
“The fact that people can walk around wearing their AirPods, that they can protect their hearing at concerts and get insights on their hearing health using these features over time — AirPods are doing what each person wants or needs them to do,” says Mazur. “They’re truly the interface to the ear.”

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the first set ofApple Intelligencefeatures for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users is now available through a free software update with the release of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1. Apple Intelligence is the personal intelligence system that harnesses the power of Apple silicon to understand and create language and images, take action across apps, and draw from personal context to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. Today marks the availability of the first set of features, with many more rolling out in the coming months.
“Apple Intelligence introduces a new era for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, delivering brand-new experiences and tools that will transform what our users can accomplish,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation in AI and machine learning to put Apple’s generative models at the core of our devices, giving our users a personal intelligence system that is easy to use — all while protecting their privacy. Apple Intelligence is generative AI in a way that only Apple can deliver, and we’re incredibly excited about its ability to enrich our users’ lives.”
“Apple Intelligence unlocks exciting new capabilities that make your iPhone, iPad, and Mac even more helpful and useful, from Writing Tools to help refine your writing, to summarized notifications that surface what’s most important, to the ability to search for almost anything in your photos and videos by simply describing it,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. “And it’s all built on a foundation of privacy with on-device processing and Private Cloud Compute, a groundbreaking new approach that extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to protect users’ information. We are thrilled to bring the first set of Apple Intelligence features to users today, and this is just the beginning.”
Systemwide Writing Tools
Deeply integrated across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, Writing Toolsallow users to refine their language by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text virtually everywhere they write, including Mail, Messages, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps.
With Rewrite, Apple Intelligence allows users to choose from different versions of what they have written, and adjust the tone — professional, concise, or friendly — to suit the audience and task at hand. Proofread checks grammar, word choice, and sentence structure while also suggesting edits — along with explanations of the edits — that users can review or quickly accept. Users can also select text and have it summarized in the form of a digestible paragraph, bulleted key points, a table, or a list.
More Natural and Conversational Siri
Siri becomes more natural, flexible, and deeply integrated into the system experience. It has a brand-new design with an elegant glowing light that wraps around the edge of the screen when active on iPhone, iPad, or CarPlay. On Mac, users can place Siri anywhere on their desktop to access it easily as they work. Users can type to Siri at any time on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and can switch fluidly between text and voice as they use Siri to accelerate everyday tasks. With richer language-understanding capabilities, Siri can follow along when users stumble over their words and maintain context from one request to the next. In addition, with extensive product knowledge, Siri can now answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products. Users can learn everything from how to take a screen recording to how to easily share a Wi-Fi password.
More Intelligent Photos App
The Photos app is even more intelligent with many new capabilities. Natural language search gives users the ability to search for just about anything by simply describing what they are looking for, like “Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt.” This works across videos, too, so users can search for something that happened in a specific segment of the video and go right to it. Search also offers smart completion suggestions to help users quickly complete a search.
For those times when an unwanted object or person ends up in the frame of a photo, the Clean Up tool gives users a way to remove distracting elements while staying true to the moment as they intended to capture it.
The Memories feature now gives users the ability to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description.1Using language and image understanding, Apple Intelligence will pick out the best photos and videos based on a user’s description, craft a storyline with chapters based on themes identified from the photos, and arrange them into a movie with its own narrative arc.
New Ways to Prioritize and Stay Focused
Staying on top of emails has never been easier. Priority Messages, a new section at the top of the inbox in Mail, shows the most urgent emails, like a same-day invitation to lunch or a boarding pass. Across their inbox, users can see summaries without needing to open a message, and for long threads, they can tap or click Summarize to view pertinent details. Additionally, Smart Reply provides suggestions for a quick response and will identify questions in an email to ensure everything is answered.
Apple Intelligence helps users prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries that allow users to scan long or stacked notifications with key details right on the Lock Screen, such as when a group chat is particularly active. A new Focus, Reduce Interruptions, surfaces only the notifications that might need immediate attention.
In the Notes and Phone apps, users can now record, transcribe, and summarize audio. When a recording is initiated while on a call in the Phone app, participants are automatically notified, and once the call ends, Apple Intelligence generates a summary to help recall key points.
Many More Features to Come
New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months.
Apple Intelligence will add new ways for users to express themselves visually. Emoji will be taken to an entirely new level with the ability to create original Genmoji by simply typing a description, and can also be personalized using a photo of a friend or family member. Image Playground will allow users to create playful images in moments. Image Wand will make notes more visually engaging by turning rough sketches into delightful images. When a user circles an empty space, Image Wand will create an image using context from the surrounding area.
In December, Writing Tools will get even more powerful with the ability for users to describe a specific change they want to apply to their text, like making a dinner party invite read like a poem, or adding more dynamic action words to a résumé. And users will have the option to access ChatGPT’s broad world knowledge within Writing Tools and Siri, allowing them to benefit from its image- and document-understanding capabilities without needing to jump between tools.
Also coming in December, a new visual intelligence experience will build on Apple Intelligence and help users learn about objects and places instantly, thanks to the new Camera Control on the iPhone 16 lineup.2Users will be able to pull up details about a restaurant in front of them and interact with information — for example, translating text from one language to another.3Camera Control will also serve as a gateway to third-party tools with specific domain expertise, like when users want to search Google for where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.
In the months to come, Priority Notifications will surface what’s most important, and Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to them. Siri will also gain onscreen awareness, as well as be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps.
Breakthrough Privacy Protections
Designed to protect users’ privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require more processing power, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of Apple devices into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. In a first for the industry, independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to continuously verify this privacy promise — an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI.
Users can choose whether or not to enable the ChatGPT integration, which is available as part of using Siri, Writing Tools, or visual intelligence with Camera Control. Users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply.

M4 features an up to 10-core CPU, with four performance cores and up to six efficiency cores. It’s up to 1.8x faster than M1, so multitasking across apps like Safari and Excel is lightning fast. A 10-core GPU provides incredible graphics performance, up to 2x faster than M1, making everything from editing photos to AAA gameplay exceptionally fast and smooth. And the faster 16-core Neural Engine is great for Apple Intelligence features like Writing Tools and other AI workloads.
M4 supports up to 32GB of unified memory and has higher memory bandwidth of 120GB/s. The display engine of the M4 family is enhanced to support two external displays in addition to a built-in display. And M4 now supports up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports, providing fast data transfer speeds and even more flexibility across peripherals.
M4 Pro: Far More Powerful and Capable than Any AI PC Chip
M4 Pro takes the advanced technologies debuted in M4 and scales them up for researchers, developers, engineers, creative pros, and other users with more demanding workflows. M4 Pro features an up to 14-core CPU consisting of up to 10 performance cores and four efficiency cores. It’s up to 1.9x faster than the CPU of M1 Pro, and up to 2.1x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2The GPU features up to 20 cores for graphics performance that is 2x that of M4, and up to 2.4x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2This huge boost in performance makes building and testing apps across multiple simulators in Xcode quicker than ever. And with the improved hardware-accelerated ray-tracing engine in the M4 family GPU, games like Control look more compelling, and pro 3D renderers can produce stunning imagery in even less time.
M4 Pro supports up to 64GB of fast unified memory and 273GB/s of memory bandwidth, which is a massive 75 percent increase over M3 Pro and 2x the bandwidth of any AI PC chip.3This, combined with the faster Neural Engine of the M4 family, means on-device Apple Intelligence models run at blazing speed. M4 Pro also supports Thunderbolt 5 on Mac, delivering up to 120Gb/s data transfer speeds, which more than doubles the throughput of Thunderbolt 4. For professionals working on larger file sizes across AI, video, code bases, and more, M4 Pro offers stunning performance and Apple silicon’s legendary power efficiency.
M4 Max: The Most Powerful Chip for a Pro Laptop
M4 Max is the ultimate choice for data scientists, 3D artists, and composers who push pro workflows to the limit. It has an up to 16-core CPU, with up to 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores. It’s up to 2.2x faster than the CPU in M1 Max and up to 2.5x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2The GPU has up to 40 cores for performance that is up to 1.9x faster than M1 Max and up to an astounding 4x faster than the latest AI PC chip.2So heavy workloads like de-noising raw video footage in DaVinci Resolve Studio can now run in real time.
M4 Max supports up to 128GB of fast unified memory and up to 546GB/s of memory bandwidth, which is 4x the bandwidth of the latest AI PC chip.3This allows developers to easily interact with large language models that have nearly 200 billion parameters. The enhanced Media Engine of M4 Max includes two video encode engines and two ProRes accelerators, making it the ultimate choice for video professionals. And like M4 Pro, M4 Max also supports Thunderbolt 5 with up to 120Gb/s data transfer capability. M4 Max rips through the most challenging pro workloads and, thanks to the energy efficiency of Apple silicon, delivers exceptional battery life in a laptop.
Apple Silicon Powers Apple Intelligence
M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max are built forApple Intelligence.4Ushering in a new era for the Mac, Apple Intelligence brings personal intelligence to the personal computer. Combining powerful generative models with industry-first privacy protections, Apple Intelligence harnesses the power of Apple silicon and the Neural Engine to unlock new ways for users to work, communicate, and express themselves on Mac. It is available in U.S. English with macOS Sequoia 15.1. With systemwide Writing Tools, users can refine their words by rewriting, proofreading, and summarizing text nearly everywhere they write. With the newly redesigned Siri, users can move fluidly between spoken and typed requests to accelerate tasks throughout their day, and Siri can answer thousands of questions about Mac and other Apple products. New Apple Intelligence features will be available in December, with additional capabilities rolling out in the coming months. Image Playground gives users a new way to create fun original images, and Genmoji allows them to create custom emoji in seconds. Siri will become even more capable, with the ability to take actions across the system and draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that is tailored to them. In December, ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, allowing users to access its expertise without needing to jump between tools.
Apple Intelligence does all this while protecting users’ privacy at every step. At its core is on-device processing, and for more complex tasks, Private Cloud Compute gives users access to Apple’s even larger, server-based models and offers groundbreaking protections for personal information. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply.
Better for the Environment
The power-efficient performance of M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max helps the all-newMacBook Prolineup meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and deliver up to 24 hours of battery life.5This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime. And for desktop systems likeiMacandMac mini, the energy efficiency of Apple silicon also reduces the total amount of energy used. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations and, as part of its ambitious Apple 2030 goal, plans to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade.

UPDATE
Driving the game forward: iPad teams up with college football
With the new nano-texture display glass and support for Apple Pencil Pro, iPad Pro with M4 seamlessly integrates into sidelines and brings new capabilities to coaches and players
Passionate tailgaters top off their bowls of jambalaya, a “Geaux Tigers” banner catches a rare breeze in the Louisiana heat, revved-up college students start to fill the stands, and over a dozeniPad Prosare on the field — it’s game day in Baton Rouge.
While the pregame revelry and Cajun cooking are longstanding traditions at Tiger Stadium, the iPad on the sidelines is entirely new: In April of this year, the NCAA approved a rule that allows college football teams to have up to 18 active tablets on hand for use on the sideline, in the coaching booth, and in the locker room during games. Taking advantage of this new rule, three conferences — the ACC, SEC, and Big Ten — chose iPad for their game day needs, including in-game video shot from the sidelines and end zone, as well as any broadcast feeds.
“The new iPad Pro with the nano-texture display technology is unbelievable,” says Doug Aucoin, Louisiana State University’s director of video.“If the nano-texture glass on the new iPad Pro wasn’t available, it would be almost impossible to view any footage on the field with the glare that comes from the sun.”
Battling the natural elements, especially glare, was an initial concern among college football staff and required technology unique to even what the NFL uses for sideline reviews. During games in the NFL, teams only have access to still images rather than video. Fortunately, iPad Pro’s new nano-texture glass maintains image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare, providing a solution well suited for viewing video outdoors.
Aucoin, who has been dubbed “the godfather of SEC video coordinators,” and became an inductee in the College Sports Video Association’s Sports Film and Video Hall of Fame in 2022, has had a front-row seat to technology’s evolution in college football. He recalls that when he started working for LSU in 1997, one of the administrative assistants in the football office still had a typewriter on her desk. Today, he oversees a sophisticated game-day system that pairs iPad with sports software to deliver video into the hands of coaches within seconds of a play ending.
Catapult, a sports performance analytics company, is the software provider for all teams in the SEC. Here’s how the in-game video happens: Each team has their own independent videographers that shoot the end zone and sideline, and they also have access to the broadcast feed. Then, each team has a staff member who’s logging the game, meaning they’re tagging plays with details — such as down, distance, offense, defense, the phase of the kicking game, and runs or passes — that can later be used for analysis.
“As they’re tagging, we are in the background chopping up the video clips, synchronizing them, and sending the video packages to iPads that are both in the coaches’ press box and on the sidelines,” says Matt Bairos, Catapult’s chief product officer.
The end result is an in-game video solution that allows players to make adjustments the very next time they hit the field.
The ACC and Big Ten work with a software company called DVSport for in-game video. In these conferences, a central replay technician logs the game, and the home team shoots the sideline and end zone angles.
“DVSport’s work with Apple is a great example of new software and hardware working together to deliver game-changing solutions,” says Brian Lowe, DVSport’s president and CEO. “Equity, speed, and high visibility are core components of the solution, and Apple’s latest iPad Pro and iPad Air truly excel in providing a simple and elegant end user experience.”
“Having iPad on the sidelines makes coaching way more effective in-game,” says Mike Saffell, University of California, Berkeley’s tight ends coach. “Live feedback enables the players and coaches to correct quickly. It also makes the game more competitive since both teams are able to fix issues on game day.”
Cal’s starting quarterback, Fernando Mendoza, agrees. “Before, there were a lot of things that we couldn’t see until after the game, so it’s great to have that coaching on the sideline. When you’re on the field, football is the same football. But when you’re off the field, now you can go with the coaches, make adjustments, get coached up, and then go back in the game, which has helped young players’ development a lot,” he says.
In terms of integrating the new technology, Bairos — as well as multiple coaches — credits the familiarity of iPad for making the process seamless. “It’s easy to use, and it’s a familiar interface — there’s zero learning curve,” he says. “We can put an iPad with our software in the coaches’ hands and they’ll be self-sufficient. They understand how to use the iPad, and they understand the touch elements.”
Billy Glasscock, Ole Miss’s general manager, points out that Apple Pencil Pro is an added perk of using iPad. “If we are ever trying to install a play based off a look in-game, the Catapult app has a whiteboard function that we can use to draw with Apple Pencil Pro or our fingertips. There is also the ability to draw over the video clip,” he says.
Rollout to players has also been seamless, given the players’ familiarity with iPad. “They grew up with these things in their hands,” says Alex Mirabal, the University of Miami’s offensive line coach.
Mirabal found iPad to be especially useful during a thrilling October matchup against Cal when the Hurricanes came from 25 points down to win by one. “On the sixth play of the game, we gave up a sack. So after the series, I was able to show the offensive line — ‘See, this is what got us,’” he says. “‘When we get this look again, this is how we need to address the situation.’ And later in the game, they brought the same exact blitz look and boom, we picked it up. So it’s very, very helpful.” Mirabal adds that the players often grab iPad to review on their own, especially at halftime.
“‘Where’s the iPad? Where’s the iPad?’ That’s the first thing we really do as soon as we come off,” says Isaiah Horton, a wide receiver for Miami. Horton points out that in addition to more efficient coaching, having iPad devices has also helped with player-to-player coordination. “It’s having that visual piece out there instead of just saying, ‘Hey, this is what I saw, but I don’t really know what you saw because quarterbacks are looking at one half of the field, and I’m on a whole opposite side of the field.’”
In the long run, Horton sees in-game iPad use changing the game for the better by keeping players and coaches on the same page. Mendoza sees a more strategy-driven game, and Glasscock envisions more complexity, with teams carrying additional plays into games knowing they may only be able to try something once before an opponent corrects for it. Mirabal sees a game that’s played at a higher level overall.
“It’s just a matter of us, as coaches, not being afraid of allowing technology to continue to get into the game,” says Mirabal. “But I don’t think — Iknowthat the iPad usage on the sideline has tremendously impacted the game in a positive manner. There isn’t one coach in America that would say that it’s been negative.”
For Aucoin, there’s another layer to witnessing the impact iPad is making on the sidelines. His dad, Erby Aucoin, who became the NFL’s first full-time film director when the New Orleans Saints hired him in 1967, essentially pioneered the practice of in-game reviews when he concocted a system of snapping Polaroid pictures from the coaching booth and then sliding them down a wire to the sidelines for review.
“It went from the Polaroid cameras to thermal printers… and now we’ve evolved into the iPads with full-blown video in game,” says Aucoin. “And you know, my dad was the first one to do that many years ago. So it’s kind of a prideful moment for me to be able to see the evolution of this whole thing.”

2024-11-11,Decrease,Apple’s Find My enables users to share the location of lost items with third parties,"Text of this article
November 11, 2024
UPDATE
Apple’s Find My enables users to share the location of lost items with third parties
Now available in beta with iOS 18.2, users can share a secure link with the location of an AirTag or Find My network accessory with others — and soon, with airlines
Apple has introduced Share Item Location, a new iOS feature that helps users locate and recover misplaced items by easily and securely sharing the location of an AirTag or Find My network accessory with third parties such as airlines. Share Item Location is available now in most regions worldwide as part of the public beta of iOS 18.2, which will soon be available to all users as a free software update for iPhone Xsand later. Find My is built with privacy and safety at its core. The shared location will be disabled as soon as a user is reunited with their item, can be stopped by the owner at any time, and will automatically expire after seven days.
“Find My is an essential tool for users around the world to keep track of and find their belongings,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services. “The Find My network and AirTag have proven to be a powerful combination for users while traveling, providing invaluable location information when bags have been misplaced or mishandled. With Share Item Location, we’re excited to give users a new way to easily share this information directly with third parties like airlines, all while protecting their privacy.”
Users can generate a Share Item Location link in the Find My app on their iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Recipients of a link will be able to view a website that shows a location of the item on an interactive map. The website will automatically update when a new location is available and will show a timestamp of the most recent update.
In the coming months, more than 15 airlines serving millions of people globally — including Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, Brussels Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eurowings, Iberia, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Turkish Airlines, United, Virgin Atlantic, and Vueling — will begin accepting Find My item locations as part of their customer service process for locating mishandled or delayed bags. More airlines will be added over time.
Apple has worked directly with partner airlines to put systems in place to privately and securely accept Share Item Location, leveraging the hundreds of thousands of Apple devices many airlines are already using. Access to each link will be limited to a small number of people, and recipients will be required to authenticate in order to view the link through either their Apple Account or partner email address.
“We’ve worked closely with Apple to incorporate Share Item Location into our baggage recovery process and are excited to make this feature available to our customers soon,” said David Kinzelman, United’s chief customer officer. “We know many of our customers are already traveling with AirTag in their checked bags, and this feature will soon make it easier for them to share location information with us safely and securely, helping our customer service agents work more efficiently and giving our customers added peace of mind. We plan to accept Find My item locations in select airports initially, with the goal of introducing the service systemwide in early 2025.”
“While more than 99 percent of checked items make it to their destination as planned, we know how stressful it can be for customers when they don’t. That’s why we’re excited to support Share Item Location beginning later this year,” said Erik Snell, Delta Air Lines’ senior vice president of Airport Customer Service, Cargo Operations, Ground Support Equipment, and Global Clean. “It will provide our team with extra visibility to reunite those items with their owners. This cutting-edge solution, developed by Apple and in partnership with Delta Air Lines, will enable us to locate items more efficiently and effectively.”
“By accepting Find My item locations, we’ll be able to offer additional peace of mind to customers who travel with AirTag in their luggage,” said Annalisa Gigante, head of innovation at IAG, the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, and LEVEL. “We’re always testing innovative solutions and enhancing our systems to ensure that checked bags reach their intended destination as quickly as possible, and we look forward to incorporating this solution into our lost baggage processes beginning later this year.”
Additionally, SITA, a leader in air transport technology, will build support for Share Item Location into WorldTracer, the baggage-tracing system used by over 500 airlines and ground handlers at more than 2,800 airports around the world.
“As the leading industry provider for end-to-end baggage management solutions, and with global passenger traffic set to double by 2040, airports and airlines worldwide will face important challenges. This collaboration with Apple will make it easy for airlines that use our industry-leading WorldTracer solution to implement Share Item Location for more efficient baggage management, and will be a huge benefit for passengers,” said Nicole Hogg, SITA’s director of Baggage. “We look forward to seeing this feature adopted across the industry to complement existing tracking tools.”
Share Item Location is built on the Find My network, a crowdsourced network of over one billion Apple devices that use Bluetooth wireless technology to detect missing devices or items nearby, and report their approximate location back to the owner. The entire process is end-to-end encrypted and anonymous, so no one else, not even Apple orFind My Network accessory manufacturers, can view a device’s location or information.

AI-Powered Features
In Final Cut Pro 11, editors can access two all-new AI-powered tools: Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions. With Magnetic Mask, editors can effortlessly isolate people and objects in a video clip without the need for a green screen or more time-consuming rotoscoping. This powerful and precise automatic analysis provides additional flexibility to customize backgrounds and environments. Editors can also combine Magnetic Mask with color correction and video effects, allowing them to precisely control and stylize each project. And with Transcribe to Captions, closed captions can be automatically generated in the timeline using an Apple-trained large language model that transcribes spoken audio.
Magnetic Mask and Transcribe to Captions join existing AI-powered features made possible by Apple’s Neural Engine, including:
Spatial Video Editing for Apple Vision Pro
Spatial video allows users to capture life’s precious moments and relive them on Apple Vision Pro. Final Cut Pro 11 now supports spatial video editing, allowing editors to import their footage and add effects,6make color corrections, and enhance their projects with titles. The depth position of titles and captured footage can also be adjusted during the editing process. Spatial video clips can be captured directly with Vision Pro, or on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and Canon’s new RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens paired with Canon EOS R7.7
Users can choose from various viewing modes to preview the left- and right-eye angles on their Mac display. And with Mac Virtual Display,8they can bring their edit into Apple Vision Pro, creating an enormous, private, and portable display that’s ideal for complex workflows. Later this year, users will be able to expand Mac Virtual Display to a new panoramic size, creating a massive 32:9 ultra-wide curved display that’s equivalent to having two 5K monitors side by side. Spatial videos can be exported directly to a user’s Photos library, viewed immediately on Vision Pro, or shared with others by uploading them to the native visionOS Vimeo app.
Timesaving Features, Blazing Speeds, and Pro Creative Tools
Final Cut Pro features advanced editing tools to help streamline creative workflows even further and save time:
Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1
Final Cut Pro for iPad 2.1 brings beloved features to the touch-first editing experience.

With haptic feedback for Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, users will feel a light pulse as they trim clips, move media, navigate the timeline, and resize viewer clips to snapping points.
Other meaningful workflow improvements include a new vertical pinch gesture that can expand or minimize clip height in the timeline; the ability to dynamically adjust the size and position of the viewer in Picture in Picture mode; and timeline support for recordings at 90 fps, 100 fps, and 120 fps on iPhone 16 Pro.
New inks for the Live Drawing feature on iPad let users add even more animations to videos with expressive new watercolor, crayon, fountain pen, and monoline pen options. And the content library expands with new modular transitions, color-grading presets, and dynamic soundtracks, along with the ability to easily highlight and overlay visuals with Picture in Picture and Callout effects.
Final Cut Camera
Final Cut Camera 1.1 brings intuitive pro controls for aspiring and professional directors. The update offers users the ability to capture Log-encoded HEVC video in standalone or Live Multicam sessions, so users can take advantage of the amazing dynamic range of Log while benefitting from reduced file sizes and even more recording time. Final Cut Camera also allows users to enable a LUT preview while recording in Log, showcasing the vibrancy of the original scene in SDR or HDR with the Apple Log LUT. With iPhone 16 Pro, users can record beautiful and crisp 4K120 fps footage for even smoother cinematic slow motion, import it into Final Cut Pro for iPad, and begin their edit.
A new advanced level helps users precisely compose shots with roll and tilt indicators, and for top-down shots, Final Cut Camera introduces a crosshairs indicator.
Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1
Logic Pro for Mac9and iPad10supercharge songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing, and are an excellent companion for Final Cut Pro editors. Today, that experience gets even better with the new Quantec Room Simulator plug-in, which allows users to tap into the legendary sound of the most acoustically accurate reverb ever created, built using the original schematics, algorithms, and code from Quantec founder and inventor Wolfgang Buchleitner. Users can select the vintage Quantec QRS to add natural acoustic space to music while preserving sonic character, or the modern Quantec Yardstick for improved clarity and detail. The Quantec QRS technology is a great tool for video editors who want to add natural-sounding spaces to dialog, foley, and music.
“The Quantec Room Simulator has been a key element to my sound for many years, appearing on records likePassionandUs. I also used it to build harmonic drones to start my live set, which then evolved into songs like ‘Across the River,’” said musician Peter Gabriel. “It’s wonderful that Apple is bringing the Quantec QRS back to life as a plug-in for Logic users around the world.”
With Reorder Mixer Channels, users can rearrange channel strips by dragging them, and can even select multiple channel strips to reorder them collectively. To make it easier to find and add any plug-in directly using a keyboard command, Logic Pro for Mac users can now search by category, company name, or even part of a plug-in name. Logic Pro for iPad also introduces Sample Folders, giving users access to their personal collection of samples directly from the built-in Sound Browser right from iPad, external storage, and iCloud Drive.

2024-11-20,Increase,Shazam hits 100 billion song recognitions,"Text of this article
November 20, 2024
UPDATE
Shazam hits 100 billion song recognitions
That’s 12 songs identified for every person on Earth
Shazam has now officially surpassed over 100 billion song recognitions since it launched. To help put that into perspective:
“This monumental milestone not only reflects how much people enjoy using Shazam, but also their appetite for new music,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats. “Music discovery is at the core of everything we do, and we keep innovating to make sure music lovers around the world can tap the Shazam button no matter where they hear music playing!”
Shazam launched in 2002 as an SMS service in the UK, and back then, music fans would dial 2580, hold up their phones to identify music, and receive the song name and artist via text message. Shazam’s following and influence continued to grow in the years that followed, but it was the 2008 debut of the App Store and introduction of Shazam’s iOS app that brought its music recognition technology to millions of users. By the summer of 2011, Shazam had already recognized over 1 billion songs.
When Shazam joined the Apple family in 2018, the service was propelled into a new era of tech advances and innovations, offering music fans more and faster ways to discover music than ever before.
Recent innovations include Music Recognition on iOS and macOS, which allows users to quickly identify music around them or within apps — even while using headphones. The latest watchOS update goes a step further by adding Shazam as a widget to the Smart Stack, proactively suggesting music recognition whenever music is detected nearby. For users on the go, the integration of Shazam into the Action button on recent iPhone and Apple Watch models enables music recognition with a simple press-and-hold, making it even easier to name that song. Shazam also enhances the experience of its Android users, with the latest Wear OS update enabling song identification directly from a user’s watch. Plus, Shazam’s Quick Settings tile now offers direct access to users’ history.
Shazam’s ever-growing popularity can also be attributed to its ability to keep on the pulse of music and to capture global music trends and moments, like during this summer’s games in Paris when Kavinsky’s “Nightcall” became the most identified song in one minute. These achievements highlight Shazam’s ongoing commitment to pushing the boundaries of music discovery while connecting over 300 million monthly active users with the artists they love.

2024-11-21,Decrease,Billie Eilish is Apple Music’s Artist of the Year for 2024,"Text of this article
November 21, 2024
UPDATE
Billie Eilish is Apple Music’s Artist of the Year for 2024
Billie Eilish was announced today as Apple Music’s Artist of the Year, recognizing the singer-songwriter’s extraordinary impact throughout 2024.
Following a historic second Academy Award win and two additional GRAMMY Awards for her contribution to Greta Gerwig’s feature-length filmBarbie, “What Was I Made For?,” Billie released her third full-length album,HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. At once vulnerable and bold, it’s the sound of a generational artist taking a massive leap forward — and the best music of her career. Upon release, the album soared to No. 1 on Apple Music’s all-genre albums chart in 138 countries worldwide.
Billie continues to make her presence felt across culture. She performed her hit “BIRDS OF A FEATHER” while representing her hometown of Los Angeles at the closing ceremony of the summer games this August — and drove her biggest day ever for Shazam volume in the process. Billie also linked up with Charli xcx for “Guess,” one of the songs of the summer, and is currently headlining the sold-outHIT ME HARD AND SOFTtour, which will extend her triumphant year well into 2025.
In addition to being nominated for seven more GRAMMY Awards this year — including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year — Billie has also become the first person to earn Apple Music Artist of the Year honors twice, having won the inaugural award in 2019.
It’s a feat that speaks not just to Apple Music’s passion for Billie’s work, but the enduring possibilities of everything she creates. If her 2019 debut,WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?— listed at No. 30 on Apple Music’s 100 Best Albums in May of this year — introduced her to the world as a teenage phenom,HIT ME HARD AND SOFThas signaled that she’s here to stay.
“From the moment we first heard ‘Ocean Eyes’ nearly a decade ago, we’ve been fans and champions of Billie’s work,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s senior director of Content and Editorial. “It’s always special when a young artist can connect with so many people so quickly. But what’s been truly remarkable about watching her evolve over the course of this last year isn’t just that her voice and artistry have continued to resonate so widely. It’s that she’s blossomed as bravely and honestly as she has — on her own terms, in her own way.”
“Since day one, Apple Music has supported my music and artistry, and I am both honored and humbled to receive this recognition as Artist of the Year this many years into my career,” Billie told Apple Music.
Celebrate the occasion by revisiting Billie’s entire catalog in Spatial Audio, and check out top playlists all week as Apple Music reveals the songs and artists that shaped and soundtracked 2024, in addition toeditors’ favorite albums of 2024.

UPDATE
Apple Podcasts namesHystericalthe 2024 Show of the Year
Host Dan Taberski reflects on the standout seven-part investigation in a special Creator Conversation
Apple is proud to celebrateHystericalwith the Apple Podcasts Award, a recognition given each year to honor a show that demonstrates quality and innovation in podcasting. The seven-part series, produced by Wondery and Audacy’s Pineapple Street Studios, investigates a mysterious illness that spreads among a group of high school girls in upstate New York.
Hystericaldebuted on Apple Podcasts in July 2024, and quickly rose to No. 1 in the Top Shows chart. Since then, fans have continued to listen and recommend the series, andHystericalended the year as the No. 9 most popular new show of the year in theTop Chartsof 2024 on Apple Podcasts.
Creator Dan Taberski was compelled to pursue this story when news of “Havana syndrome” — a mysterious illness impacting thousands of diplomats and hardened CIA agents around the world — started to spring up in the media. He recalled the story about a group of high school girls in Le Roy, New York, who were affected by a separate mysterious illness several years prior. Drawn to the potential parallels between these unlikely groups of people, he thought, “What if it’s a hysterical illness?”
“A lot of people still think it was an attack from some sort of microwave weapon,” Taberski says of the Havana syndrome news. “The media was pontificating about it, and they were interviewing all these people who were suffering from it, but everybody was really afraid to say, ‘What if it’s all in your head?’ So I thought it would be interesting to pair that story in Le Roy with what was happening to these diplomats and CIA officers to show that it can happen to anybody.”
“Dan Taberski has continually been at the forefront of podcast documentary, and withHysterical, he is operating at the top of his game. He uniquely taps into the zeitgeist with humor, insight and a breeziness that listeners have always flocked to,” said Jenna Weiss-Berman, Audacy’s executive vice president of Podcasts. “We’re so grateful for the work Apple Podcasts does to showcase Dan’s voice and to continue advancing this genre.”
“We could not be more excited that Apple Podcasts has chosen to recognizeHystericalas its Show of the Year,” said Marshall Lewy, Wondery’s chief content officer. “Dan is a breakthrough storyteller and a true podcast auteur — he has a singular ability to present questions, and with his own unique approach, he will leave you completely enraptured and ready to go down the rabbit hole with him. Investigative limited series likeHystericalgive listeners an opportunity to dive into complex, real-world stories that have no easy answers and take audiences on a journey. There’s no one better than Dan at this.”
In aspecial conversationavailable today on Apple Podcasts for Creators, excerpted below, Taberski discusses how he knows when he has an intriguing story, the importance of questions that lead to more questions, and his team’s approach to uncovering new aspects of the mystery in each episode.
On pursuing the right story:“When I’m trying to decide if I want to do a project, the more time I spend with it, the more questions I have to have. If the questions dry up pretty quickly, you kind of know it’s not worth it. But, if the more time you spend with it, the more unsure you are, the more questions you have, the more doors it opens, the more things there are to wrestle with — that I think the listener would be interested to wrestle with as well — that’s when I get really into it. When I’m properly confused, and I really have questions, and I’m excited to sit down with as many people as possible and ask them about it, and to get answers — once I’m at that confused state, I’m ready to go.”
On bringing together the right crew:“I work with a team of collaborators that has been pretty consistent, and that sort of creative relationship really builds over the course of years. It’s really helpful to have people who are interrogating it with you as you’re going along. It’s part of the fun. There’s also something about the fact that podcasting and the format of narrative audio documentary is still pretty new.”
On enjoying the journey:“There’s something that’s so fresh about it, and you really are figuring it out as you’re going along, and the people that you’re working with are figuring it out as you’re going along, even though they are able to build on what they already know and what they’ve already learned, and that struggle keeps it really interesting. Enjoying that struggle instead of freaking out about it is a big part of how to approach a limited series.”
These excerpts have been edited for clarity and brevity.
All episodes ofHystericalare available now on Apple Podcasts. Subscribe toWondery+for access to ad-free episodes.
Apple Podcasts also recently announced new ways for listeners to celebrate and discovernarrative serieswith a new Top Series chart, a new Series category, and Series Essentials, a feature recognizing one series every month that best defines the category.

December 10, 2024
PRESS RELEASE
Apple Music expands live global radio offering with three brand-new stations
The new Apple Música Uno, Apple Music Club, and Apple Music Chill live-hosted radio stations offer listeners more exclusive shows from some of the world’s most vital artists, including Becky G, Rauw Alejandro, Grupo Frontera, Honey Dijon, Jamie xx, FKA twigs, Nia Archives, Brian Eno, Stephan Moccio, and more
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today launched three new live global radio stations on Apple Music. Music fans around the world can now tune in to Apple Música Uno, Apple Music Club, and Apple Music Chill — in addition to Apple Music 1, Apple Music Hits, and Apple Music Country — and listen to live-hosted radio for free, without a subscription, onApple Music Radio.
“Apple Music Radio is the beating heart of our service, representing the intersection of exceptional human voices and curation with cutting-edge technology that shapes and influences culture,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Music, Sports, and Beats. “We put a lot of time and care into making sure these new radio stations are really bespoke, highly curated, and hosted by some of the world’s best music commentators with unique programming that we know our listeners will love.”
Since launching in 2015, the award-winning Apple Music Radio has become the home for exclusive programming by top global music experts and content that music lovers can’t find anywhere else — from interviews with the biggest artists on the planet across genres, to shows hosted and shaped by the artists themselves.
“Music is crucial to our health and happiness, and what Apple Music Radio brings is a sense that your music is always there for you, always on, and waiting for you to just tap in,” said Zane Lowe, Apple Music’s global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. “In a world of AI and algorithms, Apple Music Radio is live. It’s real people, it’s a shared event, and I’m so excited to be broadening that experience to listeners worldwide with three new stations.”
Introducing Apple Música Uno
Apple Música Unospeaks directly to the wealth of stylistic diversity in Latin music around the world. The focus will always be on music, specifically what’s new, current, and moving culture — from Música Mexicana and reggaetón, to tropical, Latin pop, and more. Latin superstar Becky G is the station’s official launch host, and fellow luminaries Rauw Alejandro and Grupo Frontera will host special shows of their own. On a daily basis, listeners will be welcomed by Evelyn Sicairos and Lechero, two prominent radio personalities whose passion for music and drawing cross-cultural connections will set the tone and energy for the station as a whole. They will each host their own flagship playlist show five days a week, with Sicairos helming La Oficial Radio, and Lechero taking over ¡Dale Play! Radio. Additional programming will include Puro Pop Radio, informed by the beloved playlist of the same name, while weekend programming will take cues from Cumbia Pa’ La Fiesta, Canciones Caras, and Por Siempre Hits.
The first song to air on Apple Música Uno will be Bad Bunny’s new release, “EL CLúB.” Artists will frequently provide track-by-track breakdowns of their own albums, as well as a look into the songs that have most recently inspired them. On-air talent will speak Spanish and English.
“I feel incredibly honored to have my own Apple Music radio show and be the voice of Apple Música Uno, where I can curate some of my favorite tracks and share my experiences with my fans,” said Becky G. “Growing up, I used to watch and listen to music programs that inspired me so much, and I was always in awe of the artists before me. Now, years later, I can’t believe I get to have my own show and hopefully inspire others in the same way. I hope fans will tune in, laugh with us, enjoy some great music, discover new tracks they haven’t heard before, and leave feeling inspired.”
Introducing Apple Music Club
Apple Music Clubis home to anyone who loves dance and electronic music, as well as club culture. But it’s also more ambitious than that. Whether in Berlin or Brooklyn, London or Tokyo, every party or club night must end at some point. It won’t on Apple Music Club, where mixes from the globe’s most important and forward-thinking DJs and dance floors will be thoughtfully curated into a set that is fully alive, and happening around the clock, every day of the year. Tim Sweeney and NAINA will act as guides, providing context around each mix, which will cover a full spectrum of sounds, from the festival circuit to the underground — all of them also available at any time as DJ Mixes on Apple Music.
To kick off the never-ending party, Sweeney will play the iconic club track “Big Fun” by the pivotal electronic dance music band Inner City. New and exclusive mixes from Honey Dijon, Jamie xx, FKA twigs, and Nia Archives have also been confirmed, in addition to sets from Apple Music curators Circoloco, Tomorrowland, The Warehouse Project, fabric, Hï Ibiza, Stone Island Sound, and many more.
“My show is a series of recordings taken from The Floor, a club that I opened for 10 days in London in May 2024,” said Jamie xx. “I invited all my friends and collaborators down to play sets alongside me. Some of my favorite DJs and artists appear in these sets, so I’m very grateful to them, and I’m so glad to be able to have all these sets here in one place for listeners on Apple Music.”
Introducing Apple Music Chill
Apple Music Chillis an escape, a refuge, a sanctuary in sound — a place listeners can turn to throughout their day. It’s a radio station committed to a mood. Programming will be a continuous flow of chill highlights across genres, interspersed with mindful moments meant to remind listeners to make the time to find center and calm. The aim is to offer respite through expert curation, a place where listeners can feel at ease at any time.
Apple Music Chill will kick off with the exclusive premiere of Beck’s new recording of George Harrison’s “Be Here Now,” the first song to air on the station. Listeners will also find the velvety tones of discerning tastemakers like Brian Eno, Stephan Moccio, and Zane Lowe expertly taking them through stories of calm and wellbeing in their own hosted shows, while Apple Music’s Sabi will act as station guide throughout the week.
“All my listening life I’ve been drawn to the slower, quieter, more mysterious end of the musical spectrum,” said Eno. “My radio show gives me the chance to share with others some of the things I’ve found there.”
Radio has a dedicated destination across all of the Apple Music ecosystem. Apple Music listeners can find a newly updated Radio tab, which will make interviews and shows hosted by artists across all stations easier than ever to discover.
Over the past decade, Apple Music Radio’s state-of-the-art studios in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, London, Paris, and Berlin have become a welcome and key destination for both established and emerging artists from around the world to release new music, break news, and speak directly to their fans.

UPDATE
Voice Memos update brings Layered Recordings :br(xl): :br(l): :br(m): to iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max
A trio of GRAMMY Award winners — multiplatinum entertainer Michael Bublé, country star Carly Pearce, and record producer Greg Wells — teamed up to bring their new track “Maybe This Christmas” to life with Voice Memos on iPhone 16 Pro
Voice Memos, a go-to app for musicians of all kinds, now offers iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max users the ability to layer a vocal track on top of an existing instrumental recording — without the need for headphones. With iOS 18.2, users will be able to play their original instrumental ideas through the iPhone speaker while simultaneously recording vocals using the new studio-quality microphones on iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.
Powered by the A18 Pro chip, and leveraging advanced processing and machine learning to isolate the vocal recording, Voice Memos creates two individual tracks so users can apply additional mixing and production in professional apps like Logic Pro. And with Voice Memos on Mac, Layered Recordings are synced across devices and available on Mac to drag-and-drop into a Logic session.
With Voice Memos, users can incorporate a variety of background instrumentals — like acoustic guitar or piano — as the first layer. In Logic Pro, artists and producers can also send an instrumental music mix as a compressed audio file directly to Voice Memos, making it easy to then record a vocal layer on top, wherever and whenever inspiration strikes.
A trio of GRAMMY Award winners — multiplatinum entertainer Michael Bublé, country star Carly Pearce, and record producer Greg Wells — teamed up to bring their new track “Maybe This Christmas” to life with Voice Memos on iPhone 16 Pro. In a behind-the-scenes video, the artists share the inspiration for their powerful holiday song, and detail how the new Voice Memos feature allowed them to record their vocals solely on iPhone 16 Pro.
“I don’t think people realize the critical role Voice Memos on iPhone plays in the creation process for musicians,” said Bublé. “And now with Layered Recordings, if an artist has a moment of inspiration, being unencumbered by the traditional studio experience becomes the advantage, not the limitation. It’s so typically Apple to build something we didn’t know we needed — and now won’t be able to live without.”
Listeners can stream “Maybe This Christmas”onApple Musicin Spatial Audio. The Layered Recordings capability for Voice Memos is available on iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max for users running iOS 18.2. Sharing to Voice Memos and importing a Layered Recording is available on Logic Pro for Mac 11.1 with macOS Sequoia 15.2, and Logic Pro for iPad 2.1 with iPadOS 18.2.

PRESS RELEASE
Apple Intelligence now features Image Playground, Genmoji, Writing Tools enhancements, seamless support for ChatGPT, and visual intelligence
Today also marks the beginning of Apple Intelligence language expansion with localized English support for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K.
CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIAApple today announced the release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, introducing a brand-new set ofApple Intelligencefeatures that will elevate users’ experience with iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and builds on thefirst set of capabilitiesalready introduced. Apple Intelligence is the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. Now users can explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, create the perfect emoji for any situation with Genmoji, and make their writing even more dynamic with new enhancements to Writing Tools. Building on Apple Intelligence, users with an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro can instantly learn more about their surroundings with visual intelligence with Camera Control. And now with ChatGPT integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise without having to switch between apps, helping them get things done faster and easier than ever before.
Today, Apple Intelligence also begins language expansion with localized English support for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K., giving even more users around the world powerful new ways to use their iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Additional languages, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will be coming throughout the year, with an initial setarriving in a software update in April.
Design Fun, Original Images with Image Playground
The Image Playground experience allows users to easily create fun and unique images, with concepts like themes, costumes, accessories, and places. Users can add their own text descriptions, and can even create images in the likeness of a family member or friend using photos from their photo library. Image Playground generates images in distinct styles, including Animation — a modern, 3D-animated look — and Illustration, which offers images with simple shapes, clear lines, and colorblocking.
The experience is integrated right into Messages, making it easier than ever to create images for conversations, as well as into apps like Freeform, Keynote, and many others. Image Playground is also available as a brand-new dedicated app.
Create Genmoji to Fit Any Moment
With the power of Apple Intelligence, emoji is taken to the next level with Genmoji, making conversations with family and friends more fun and playful, and opening up entirely new ways to communicate.
By simply typing a description into the emoji keyboard, a Genmoji will appear, including multiple options to choose from. With images from their photo library, users can take Genmoji even further by creating one that is inspired by a friend or family member. Personalized Genmoji can be customized with accessories, like a hat or sunglasses, and can reflect themes or activities to make them even more personal and unique. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback.1
Take Notes to the Next Level with Image Wand
The Notes app gets new tools to make note-taking more visual and dynamic. With Image Wand in the tool palette, users can quickly create images in their note using the written or visual context already captured within the note.
Image Wand transforms a rough sketch into a polished image by simply circling it. Users can even circle empty space within a note, and Image Wand will gather context from the surrounding area — using on-device generative models to analyze the handwritten or typed text — to create a relevant image that complements the note and makes it more visual. Users can create images with the Animation, Illustration, and an additional Sketch style in Image Wand.
Describe Changes in Writing Tools
Writing Tools build on the existing options of Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize with the new ability for users to specify the change they’d like to make, using the new Describe Your Change option. Describe Your Change gives users even more flexibility and control when they’d like to make their writing sound more expressive, such as to add more dynamic action words to their resume or even rewrite a dinner party invitation in the form of a poem, and more. Just like all of the features with Writing Tools, this new Describe Your Change option is available systemwide across Apple and many third-party apps.
Learn More About Surroundings in One Click with Visual Intelligence
A new visual intelligence experience builds on Apple Intelligence and helps users learn about objects and places instantly, thanks to the new Camera Control on the iPhone 16 lineup. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, and more. Camera Control also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills to ask for an explanation about a complex diagram, such as from class notes. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared.
Tap into ChatGPT with Siri and Writing Tools
Apple is enabling ChatGPT access in Siri and Writing Tools experiences within iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between applications. With the ChatGPT integration, Siri can suggest a user access ChatGPT for certain requests, and Siri can provide the response directly.
With Compose, users can ask ChatGPT to generate content for anything they are writing about from the systemwide Writing Tools. They can also use ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities to add images alongside their written content.
Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT. By default, a ChatGPT account is not required to use this integration. When using ChatGPT without an account, OpenAI will not store requests, and will not use the data for model training. Additionally, users’ IP addresses are obscured to prevent their sessions from being linked together. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply.
Even More Capabilities Coming Soon
Additional Apple Intelligence capabilities will be available in the months to come. Siri will be even more capable, with the ability to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to them. Siri will also gain onscreen awareness, and will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. Priority Notifications will also surface what’s most important. In addition, users will be able to create images in Image Playground in a Sketch style, an academic and highly detailed style that uses a vibrant color palette combined with technical lines to produce realistic drawings.
A Breakthrough for Privacy in AI
Designed to protect users’ privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to continuously verify this privacy promise, and are already doing so. This is an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI.

His Majesty King Charles III visits Apple’s U.K. headquarters
On Thursday, December 12, His Majesty King Charles III visited Apple’s Battersea office in London to meet Apple employees, members of the British creative community, and students who have learned vital new skills like coding from educational programs supported by Apple and U.K.-based nonprofit The King’s Trust.
Team members from across the country welcomed His Majesty to the historic Battersea Power Station, which has been Apple’s U.K. headquarters since 2023. To mark the occasion, children from the nearby St. George’s Primary School created holiday artwork on iPad, which was then projected onto the power station’s iconic chimneys. Apple CEO Tim Cook joined King Charles to welcome the local community to a special holiday concert by award-winning British musician RAYE.
“We were honored to welcome His Majesty King Charles to Apple Battersea — our home in the U.K. — and we’re proud to support The King’s Trust in its vital work educating and empowering young people,” said Cook. “We look forward to our continued growth here, building on more than 40 years of history in the United Kingdom.”
