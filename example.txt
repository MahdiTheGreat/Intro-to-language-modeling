Anatomy

Anatomy (Greek anatomē, “dissection”) is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts.  Anatomy is a branch of natural science dealing with the structural organization of living things.  It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times.  Anatomy is inherently tied to embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated over immediate (embryology) and long (evolution) timescales.  Human anatomy is one of the basic essential sciences of medicine.

The discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic anatomy.  Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight.  Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy.  Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.
